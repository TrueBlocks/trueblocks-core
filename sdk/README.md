## Introduction

This directory holds auto-generated SDKs based on the [TrueBlocks API](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core). This SDK is intended for use by the core developers of TrueBlocks as we develop our own applications, and is therefore purposefully not well documented. This is so we **do not** create an unwanted support burden for our team. You are welcome to use the SDK, but we will do not provide technical support.

However, we do welcome issues and PR's (particularly documentation) from the community.

## The SDKs

There are two SDKs so far:

- [Typescript](./typescript/README.md)
- [Python](./python/README.md)

## Docker version

These SDKs are easiest to use with our [docker version](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-docker) which is in a separate repo. Please see that repo for information on running with Docker.

## Documentation

The TrueBlocks [documentation repo](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-docs) builds the TrueBlocks website. See our website for the [best available documentation](https://trueblocks.io/).
