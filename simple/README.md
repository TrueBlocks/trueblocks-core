## Overview

This is a purposefully simple example intended to get your started.

The example application retrieves blocks at a monthly interval using the TrueBlocks SDK.
The application then prints the block numbers and their corresponding dates and quits. Simple.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed and running:

- Go 1.22 or higher
- TrueBlocks Core 3.0.0 or higher

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core.git
```

Build TrueBlocks Core by following the ([installation instructions](https://trueblocks.io/docs/install/install-core/)), and then navigate to the example directory:

```bash
cd ../examples/simple
```

## Usage

Run the example using the following command:

```bash
go run .
```

There are no command line options.

### Output

The above will render data similar to the following. Note that each record represents the last block in the given month which would be useful, for example, in an accounting app.
