## For migrations prior to version v1.0.0

Migrations prior to version v1.0.0 are no longer supported. If your data is this older than v1.0.0, you must remove your existing caches and indexes. Do so by running this command:

```
chifra config --paths
```

and then removing the folders presented. Do this only if your data is prior to version 1.0.0. You may make a backup if you wish, but these older files are no longer useful for `chifra`.
