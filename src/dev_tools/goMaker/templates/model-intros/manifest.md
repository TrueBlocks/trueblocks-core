The Manifest details the portions of the index of appearances which are called ChunkRecords. Each record in the
Manifest details the block range represented by the chunk as well as the IPFS hash of the index chunk along with
the associated IPFS hash for the Bloom filter of the chunk. The manifest itself is also pushed to IPFS and the
IPFS of the hash of the manifest is published periodically to the Unchained Index smart contract.
