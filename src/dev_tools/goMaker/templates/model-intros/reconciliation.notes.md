**Intra-block transactions**: In many cases two or more transactions requiring a reconciliation may occur in a single block. Because the Ethereum blockchain only provides balance queries at the end of blocks, it is not possible to query for the balance of an asset at the end of transactions for which there are other following transactions in the block nor for the beginning balance for which there are transactions prior to the given transaction in the same block. In these cases, TrueBlocks simulates the beginning and ending balance as needed and adds `partial` to the `reconciliationType`.

**Spot Price**: If the `spotPrice` is available from an on-chain source (such as UniSwap), then it represents the ETH/DAI value at the time of the transaction if the reconciliation is for ETH. For other assets, the `spotPrice` represents the asset's value relative to `ETH`, so to price a non-ETH asset in US dollars, one would need to convert first to `ETH` then to dollars. If a price is not available on-chain, the `spotPrice` will be zero and the caller is encouraged to get the price for the asset from other sources.
