An ABI describes an Application Binary Interface -- in other words, the [Function](/data-model/other/#function)
and Event signatures for a given smart contract. Along with [Names](/data-model/accounts/#names) the
use of ABIs goes a very long way towards making your Ethereum data much more understandable.

Similar to names of addresses, ABI files are not available on-chain which means they must be
acquired somewhere. Unfortunately, the Ethereum community has not yet understood that Etherscan
is not a good place to store this very important information. For this reason, TrueBlocks uses
Etherscan to acquire ABI files and therefore one needs to get an Etherscan API key to use this
function.
