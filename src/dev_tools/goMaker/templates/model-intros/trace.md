The deepest layer of the Ethereum data is the trace. Every transaction has at least one trace which
is itself a record of the transaction. If the `to` address of the transaction is a smart contract,
other traces may appear, if, for example, that smart contract calls other smart contracts.

Traces may be arbitrarily deep (up to the gasLimit) and ultimately represent a tree of function
calls. Some transactions have 100s of traces. The format of the trace is similar to the transaction
itself have a trace `action` (which contains `from`, `to`, `value` like the transaction) and the
trace `result` (containing `gasUsed` like the receipt).
