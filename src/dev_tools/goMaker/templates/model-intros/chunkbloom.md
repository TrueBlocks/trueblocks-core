The `blooms` data model represents the bloom filter files that front the Unchained Index index
portions. The information here is mostly for internal use only as it includes the size and number
of the bloom filters present as well as the number of addresses inserted into the bloom. This
information is used to study the characteristics of the Unchained Index.
