ABI files are derived from the Solidity source code of a smart contract by extracting the canonical
function and event signatures in a JSON structure. The function signatures are hashed (using
keccak) into four-byte encodings for functions and 32-byte encodings for events. Because the
blockchain only deals with byte data, TrueBlocks needs a way to decode the bytes back into the
human-readable function and event signatures. We call this process `--articulate`. Most TrueBlocks
commands provide an `--articulate` option. See the commands themselves for more information.
