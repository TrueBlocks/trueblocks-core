The following commands provide useful miscellaneous tools:

- `chifra explore` a quick way to open a blockchain explorer,
- `ethslurp` an older tool that lets you call data from Etherscan. (This has issues of centralization and data quality, see explanation in its section).

Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below.
