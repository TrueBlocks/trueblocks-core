Given the address of an ERC20 token contract, the `[{NAME}]` tool reports token balances for one or
more additional addresses. Alternatively, the tool can report the token balances for multiple ERC20
tokens for a single addresses.

In normal operation the **first item** in the `address_list` is assumed to be an ERC20 token
contract whose balances are being queried, whereas the remainder of the list is assumed to be
addresses on which to report.

In `--byAcct` mode, **all addresses** in the `address_list` are assumed to be ERC20 token contracts,
except the final one which is the account whose token balances are reported.

You may optionally specify one or more blocks at which to report. If no block is specified, the
latest block is assumed. You may also optionally specify which parts of the token data to extract.
