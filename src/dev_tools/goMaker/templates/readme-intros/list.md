`chifra {{.Route}}` takes one or more addresses, queries the index of appearances, and builds TrueBlocks
monitors. A TrueBlocks monitor is a file that contains blockNumber.transactionIndex pairs (transaction
identifiers) representing the history of the address.

Because TrueBlocks only extracts data from the Ethereum node when it's requested, the first time
you list an address it takes about a minute. Subsequent queries are much faster because TrueBlocks
caches the results.

Note that `chifra list` only queries the index, it does not extract the full transactional details.
You may use `chifra export` for that.
