The `[{NAME}]` tools provides a major part of the functionality of the TrueBlocks system. Using
the index of appearances created with `chifra scrape` and the list of transaction identifiers
created with `chifra list`, `[{NAME}]` completes the actual extraction of an address's transactional
history from the node.

You may use `topics`, `fourbyte` values at the start of a transaction's input data, and/or a log's
`source address` or `emitter` to filter the results.

You may also choose which portions of the Ethereum data structures (`--transactions`, `--logs`,
`--traces`, etc.) as you wish.

By default, the results of the extraction are delivered to your console, however, you may export
the results to any database (with a little bit of work). The format of the data, its content and
its destination are up to you.
