The Admin group of commands allows you to query the status of the TrueBlocks system and
manage various aspects including the Unchained Index. You may query the status; query for information
about TrueBlocks caches; control the creation, sharing, and pinning of the Unchained Index; and even
serve the data through an API.

See [the API documentation](/api) for all information about using the API.

To the right is a list of commands in this group. Click on a command to see its full documentation.
