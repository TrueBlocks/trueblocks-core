goMaker - TrueBlocks Code Generator

This tool generates code for the TrueBlocks project based on template files.

Requirements to run successfully:
  1. A 'templates' folder must exist in one of these locations:
     - src/dev_tools/goMaker/templates
     - code_gen/templates

  2. The templates folder must contain:
     - base-types.csv: Defines base data types
     - cmd-line-options.csv: Defines command line options
     - classDefinitions/: Contains TOML files defining structures
     - generators/: Contains template files (.tmpl) for code generation

Generators:
  The files in the generators/ folder follow a naming convention that determines
  where the generated files will be placed:
  - Files are organized in subdirectories like generators/routes/, generators/sdk/, etc.
  - Paths in template filenames are converted to directory structures
  - Special placeholders in filenames are replaced during generation:
    * _route_ -> /{routeTag}/
    * route.go -> {routeTag}.go
    * route.md -> {routeTag}.md
    * route.py -> {routeTag}.py
    * route.ts -> {routeTag}.ts
    * +type+ -> +{typeTag}+
    * type.go -> {typeTag}.go
    * type.md -> {typeTag}.md
    * type.ts -> {typeTag}.ts
    * _capType -> _{viewName(typeTag)}
    * group.md -> {groupTag}.md
    * _reason_ -> _chifra_ or _data-model_ (depending on reason)
    * Underscores (_) are converted to slashes (/)
    * Plus signs (+) are converted to underscores (_)

Environment Variables:
  TB_MAKER_SINGLE: Limit processing to a specific source
  TB_GENERATOR_FILTER: Filter what gets generated
  TB_REMOTE_TESTING: Set to 'true' for remote testing behavior

Command-line options:
  --help: Display this help text
