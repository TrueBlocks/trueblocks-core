## chifra serve

`chifra serve` delivers a JSON API for each of the `chifra` commands along with each of its options.
It does this through `flame` server, which is written in Go.

[Get help with the API here](https://www.tokenomics.io/api.html
).

Another way to get help to run `chifra --help` or `chifra <cmd> --help` on your command line. See below for an example of converting command line options to a call to the API. There's a one-to-one correspondence between the command line tools and options and the API routes and their options.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Serve the TrueBlocks API using the flame server.

  chifra serve [flags]

  -h, --help         display this help screen
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)

Notes:
  - To start API open terminal window and run chifra serve.
  - See the API documentation for more information.
```

Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --dollars         export values in US dollars
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
