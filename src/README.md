## Source Code

The source code is laid out in the following folders:

- [**The libs folder**](./libs/README.md): This folder holds the C++ library code that helps us build out various applications and command-line tools. All of this code is open source.

- [**The apps folder**](./apps/README.md): This folder contains source code for the primary applications that comprise the system. Some of this source code is open source and some is not.

- [**The tools folder**](./tools/README.md): This folder contains open source code for a collection of simple command line tools. These tools, while useful, serve primarily as sample code for the libraries to help you understand how to use TrueBlocks.

- [**The samples folder**](./samples/README.md): This folder contains other open source sample source code for the system. You can get a lot of ideas here, but many of these samples are partial or incomplete. Please add to the list and/or feel free to expand any of these samples.

- [**The other folder**](./other/README.md): This folder contains various other documents such as installation instructions, FAQs, and other tools you may find useful.

- [**The monitors folder**](./monitors/README.md): This folder holds proprietary code for monitoring, recording, replaying, debugging and accounting for smart contracts and builds per-account lists of transactions.
