---------------------
Steps
---------------------


1) Install basic development tools (it includes git client):

   as root user

   > yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

   or 

   with sudo user

   > sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

2) Install cmake:

   > yum install cmake  (as root or with sudo)

3) Install python:

   > yum install python python-devel (as root or with sudo)

4) Install CURL

   > yum install libcurl-devel (as root or with sudo)

5) Create the workspace folder. At command line execute:

   > cd <USER_DIRECTORY>    (where USER_DIRECTORY is the directory we want to wokr at)
   > mkdir workspace
   > cd workspace
   
 
6) Clone github repository (master branch by default):

   > git clone https://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/quickBlocks.git .



7) Do the cmake + make steps

  >  mkdir build
  >  cd build
  >  cmake ../src
  >  make
