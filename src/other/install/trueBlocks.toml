# The 'rpcProvider' value points to a valid RPC endpoint. TrueBlocks will not
# work without it. If you're running your own local node, this will default to
# http://localhost:8545, however in many cases, you will need to point this
# elsewhere such as to Infura or QuickNodes, or (if the world is just) your
# dAppNode.
rpcProvider = "http://localhost:8545"

# ******
# The following descriptions reference a value called $(configPath). This value
# is not customizable and defaults to $HOME/Library/Application Support/TrueBlocks
# on Mac and $HOME/.local/share/trueblocks on Linux.
# ******

# The 'cachePath' points to the location of the TrueBlocks cache. Data from
# the node will be cached only if you query it directly (lazy extraction). 
# The cache stores ABI files, named addresses, block data, transaction data,
# traces, logs, etc. Some items are cached by default (ABIs, names). Others
# (such as blocks, transactions, and traces) are only cached if you specify 
# so via the command line.
#
# This value defaults to "$(configPath)/cache/". If the value is empty or 
# "<NOT_SET>", it will default to the above.
cachePath = "<NOT_SET>"

# The 'indexPath' value defaults to "$(configPath)/unchained/". If you wish
# to modify it, uncomment the line below and set it to your own path. By default,
# the unchained index (which is what we call the index of appearances) takes up
# about 2 GB on of disc space, however if you build the entire index, it may take
# up to 80 GB. You may wish to point this value to an external drive in that case.
# indexPath = "<NOT_SET>"

# The 'etherscan_key' value is optional but if not provided will disable your
# ability to use the articulate feature in various places. We apologize profusely
# for this centralization cancer, but the community must decide what it wants
# to share with private companies and what it does not wish to share. Go to
# the EtherScan website, tell them who you are, get an etherscan_key are enter it here.
