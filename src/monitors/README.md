The monitor folder is a private repo that holds software built to monitor particular smart contracts systems. This allows us to build accounting, auditing, forcasting, and analytics programs for use in a variety of applications.

A monitor is fully customizable and may be directed to `watch` multiple smart contract and/or external Ethereum addresses. One may even watch multiple smart contract systems together giving unparalleled insight into what's going on in your systems.

Monitors take advantage of the [apps](../apps/README.md), [tools](../tools/README.md) and [libraries](../libs/README.md) that comprise the system.

Do you have a smart contract system that you would like us to monitor for you? Can we help you build your own smart contract monitors? Please contact us to explore the possibilities.
