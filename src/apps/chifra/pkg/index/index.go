// Each Index contains a HeaderRecord followed by two tables: the AddressTable and a related AppearanceTable.

// The HeaderRecord (44 bytes long) contains a four-byte magic number (`0xdeadbeef` -- to indicate we're reading
// a file of the correct type), a 32-byte hash representing the file's version, and two 4-byte integers representing
// the number of records in the AddressTable (nAddresses) and the number of records in the AppearanceTable (nAppearances)
// respectively.
//
// The AddressTable has nAddresses records, one for each address that appears in any block between Start to End
// inclusive. These addresses are found using the TrueBlocks Appearance Finder algorithm. Each AddressRecord consists
// of a 20-byte address followed by two 4-byte integers representing the Offset into the AppearanceTable where
// this address's list of appearances starts followed by the Count of appearance records for the given address.
//
// The AppearanceTable contains nAppeeances pairs of <blockNumber.transactionId> pairs arranged by the Offset
// and Count pairs found in the corresponding AddressTable records.
