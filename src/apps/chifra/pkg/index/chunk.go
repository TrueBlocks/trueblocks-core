// Package index provides tools needed to acquire, read, write and test for set inclusion in an index chunk.
//
// An index chunk is a data structure with three parts. A FileRange which indicates the first block
// and last block of the chunk (inclusive), the Index which carries the list of address appearances
// in the given block range, and a Bloom which allows for rapid queries to determine if a given address
// appears in the Index without having to read the data from disc.
//
// The bloom filter returns true or false indicating either that the address MAY appear in the index or
// that it definitely does not. (In other words, there are false positives but no false negatives.)
//
// We do not read the actual data into memory, choosing instead to Seek the data directly from disc. Experimentation
// teaches us that this is faster given due to the nature of the data.
