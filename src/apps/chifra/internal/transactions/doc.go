// Package transactionsPkg handles the chifra transactions command. It The  tool retrieves transactions directly from the Ethereum node (using the --raw option) or from the TrueBlocks cache (if present). You may specify multiple transaction identifiers per invocation. Unlike the Ethereum RPC, the reported transactions include the transaction's receipt and generated logs. The --articulate option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract (including those encountered in a trace--if the --trace option is enabled) to better describe the reported data. The --trace option attaches an array transaction traces to the output (if the node you're querying has --tracing enabled), while the --uniq option displays a list of uniq address appearances instead of the underlying data (including uniq addresses in traces if enabled).
