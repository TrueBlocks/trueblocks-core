## chifra transactions

The `chifra transactions` tool retrieves transactions directly from the Ethereum node or from the TrueBlocks cache (if present). You may specify multiple transaction identifiers
per invocation. Unlike the Ethereum RPC, the reported transactions include the transaction's receipt
and generated logs.

The `--articulate` option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract (including those
encountered in a trace--if the `--trace` option is enabled) to better describe the reported data.

The `--trace` option attaches an array transaction traces to the output (if the node you're querying
has --tracing enabled), while the `--uniq` option displays a list of uniq address appearances
instead of the underlying data (including uniq addresses in traces if enabled).

Purpose:
  Retrieve one or more transactions from the chain or local cache.

Usage:
  chifra transactions [flags] <tx_id> [tx_id...]

Arguments:
  transactions - a space-separated list of one or more transaction identifiers (required)

Flags:
  -a, --articulate        articulate the retrieved data if ABIs can be found
  -t, --traces            include the transaction's traces in the results
  -u, --uniq              display a list of uniq addresses found in the transaction
  -f, --flow string       for the uniq option only, export only from or to (including trace from or to)
                          One of [ from | to ]
  -l, --logs              display only the logs found in the transaction(s)
  -m, --emitter strings   for the --logs option only, filter logs to show only those logs emitted by the given address(es)
  -B, --topic strings     for the --logs option only, filter logs to show only those with this topic(s)
  -R, --cache_traces      force the transaction's traces into the cache
  -H, --ether             specify value in ether
  -o, --cache             force the results of the query into the cache
  -D, --decache           removes related items from the cache
  -x, --fmt string        export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose           enable verbose output
  -h, --help              display this help screen

Notes:
  - The transactions list may be one or more transaction hashes, blockNumber.transactionID pairs, or a blockHash.transactionID pairs.
  - This tool checks for valid input syntax, but does not check that the transaction requested actually exists.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results for most older transactions are undefined.
  - The --decache option removes the all transaction(s) and all traces in those transactions from the cache.

### Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

**Note:** For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any
valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start
of any line makes it a comment.

**Note:** If you use `--output --append` option and at the same time the `--file` option, you may not switch
export formats in the command file. For example, a command file with two different commands, one with `--fmt csv`
and the other with `--fmt json` will produce both invalid CSV and invalid JSON.
