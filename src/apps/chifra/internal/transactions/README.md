## chifra transactions

The `chifra transactions` tool retrieves transactions directly from the Ethereum node (using the `--raw` option) or from the TrueBlocks cache (if present). You may specify multiple transaction identifiers per invocation. Unlike the Ethereum RPC, the reported transactions include the transaction's receipt and generated logs.

The `--articulate` option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract (including those encountered in a trace--if the `--trace` option is enabled) to better describe the reported data.

The `--trace` option attaches an array transaction traces to the output (if the node you're querying has --tracing enabled), while the `--uniq` option displays a list of uniq address appearances instead of the underlying data (including uniq addresses in traces if enabled).

Purpose:
  Retrieve one or more transactions from the chain or local cache.

Usage:
  chifra transactions [flags] <tx_id> [tx_id...]

Arguments:
  transactions - a space-separated list of one or more transaction identifiers (required)

Flags:
  -a, --articulate         articulate the retrieved data if ABIs can be found
  -t, --trace              include the transaction's traces in the results
  -u, --uniq               display a list of uniq addresses found in the transaction
  -r, --reconcile string   reconcile the transaction as per the provided address
  -o, --cache              force the results of the query into the tx cache (and the trace cache if applicable)
  -x, --fmt string         export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose            enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help               display this help screen

Notes:
  - The transactions list may be one or more transaction hashes, blockNumber.transactionID pairs, or a blockHash.transactionID pairs.
  - This tool checks for valid input syntax, but does not check that the transaction requested actually exists.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results for most older transactions are undefined.
```

Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --dollars         export values in US dollars
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
