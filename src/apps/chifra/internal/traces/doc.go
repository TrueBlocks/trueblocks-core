// Package tracesPkg handles the chifra traces command. It The  tool retrieves a transaction's traces. You may specify multiple transaction identifiers per invocation. The --articulate option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract to better describe the reported data. The --filter option calls your node's trace_filter routine (if available) using a bang-separated string of the same values used by trace_fitler.
