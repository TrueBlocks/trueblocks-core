## chifra when

The `chifra when` tool answers one of two questions: (1) "At what date and time did a given block occur?" or (2) "What block occurred at or before a given date and time?"

In the first case, supply a block number or hash and the date and time of that block are displayed. In the later case, supply a date (and optionally a time) and the block number that occurred at or just prior to that date is displayed.

The values for `date` and `time` are specified in JSON format. `hour`/`minute`/`second` are optional, and if omitted, default to zero in each case. Block numbers may be specified as either integers or hexadecimal number or block hashes. You may specify any number of dates and/or blocks per invocation.

Purpose:
  Find block(s) based on date, blockNum, timestamp, or 'special'.

Usage:
  chifra when [flags] < block | date > [ block... | date... ]

Arguments:
  blocks - one or more dates, block numbers, hashes, or special named blocks (see notes)

Flags:
  -l, --list          export a list of the 'special' blocks
  -t, --timestamps    display or process timestamps
  -u, --count         with --timestamps only, returns the number of timestamps in the cache
  -r, --repair uint   with --timestamps only, repair a single timestamp by querying the chain
  -c, --check         with --timestamps only, checks the validity of the timestamp data
  -x, --fmt string    export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose       enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help          display this help screen

Notes:
  - The block list may contain any combination of number, hash, date, special named blocks.
  - Block numbers, timestamps, or dates in the future are estimated with 13 second blocks.
  - Dates must be formatted in JSON format: YYYY-MM-DD[THH[:MM[:SS]]].
```

#### Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --dollars         export values in US dollars
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
