## chifra config

The `chifra config` program allows you to manage the various TrueBlocks caches. You may list all of the
caches, some of the cache, or even individual caches either in terse or full detail. The cache of
interest is specified with the `modes` option.

TrueBlocks maintains caches for the index of address appearances, named addresses, abi files, as
well as other data including blockchain data, and address monitors.

### Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

**Note:** For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any
valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start
of any line makes it a comment.

**Note:** If you use `--output --append` option and at the same time the `--file` option, you may not switch
export formats in the command file. For example, a command file with two different commands, one with `--fmt csv`
and the other with `--fmt json` will produce both invalid CSV and invalid JSON.
