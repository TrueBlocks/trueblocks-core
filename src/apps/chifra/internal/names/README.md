## chifra names

`chifra names` is a surprisingly useful tool. It allows one to associate textual names with Ethereum addresses. One may ask why this is necessary given that ENS exists. The answer is a single word: "privacy". ENS names are public. In many cases, users desire to keep personal addresses private. Try to do this on a website.

Like `chifra abis`, this tool is useful from the command line but is primarily used in support of other tools, especially `chifra export` where naming addresses becomes the single best way to turn unintelligible blockchain data into understandable information.

The various options allow you to search and filter the results. The `tags` option is used primarily by the TrueBlocks explorer.

You may use the TrueBlocks explorer to manage (add, edit, delete) address-name associations.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Query addresses or names of well known accounts.

Usage:
  chifra names [flags] <term> [term...]

Arguments:
  terms - a space separated list of one or more search terms (required)

Flags:
  -e, --expand       expand search to include all fields (search name, address, and symbol otherwise)
  -m, --match_case   do case-sensitive search
  -l, --all          include all accounts in the search
  -c, --custom       include your custom named accounts
  -p, --prefund      include prefund accounts
  -n, --named        include well know token and airdrop addresses in the search
  -a, --addr         display only addresses in the results (useful for scripting)
  -g, --tags         export the list of tags and subtags only
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help         display this help screen

Notes:
  - The tool will accept up to three terms, each of which must match against any field in the database.
  - The --match_case option enables case sensitive matching.
```

#### Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --dollars         export values in US dollars
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
