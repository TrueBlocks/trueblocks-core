// Package chunksPkg handles the chifra chunks command. It provides tools for interacting with, checking the validity of, cleaning up, and analyzing the Unchained Index. It provides options to list pins, the Manifest, summary data on the index, Bloom filters, addresses, and appearances. While still in its early stages, this tool will eventually allow users to clean their local index, clean their remote index, study the indexes, etc. Stay tuned.
