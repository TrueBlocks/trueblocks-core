## chifra slurp

`chifra slurp` is the first tool we built in the Ethereum space. It even has its [own website](http://ethslurp.com).

While it's useful, it has two shortcomings. First, it is fully centralized, pulling its data from [http://etherscan.io](http://etherscan.io). Second, is that it does not report every transaction for a given account. This is actually a shortcoming with EtherScan. It's too complicated to explain here, but see our blog.

While `chifra slurp` has its shortcomings, it does provides some nice features. You may use it to pull any transaction initiated by an EOA for example or to explore mining rewards. Visit the above referenced website for more information.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Fetch data from EtherScan for any address.

  chifra slurp [flags] <address> [address...] [block...]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses to slurp from Etherscan (required)
  blocks - an optional range of blocks to slurp

Flags:
  -t, --types strings   which types of transactions to request
                        One or more of [ ext | int | token | nfts | miner | uncles | all ]
  -p, --appearances     show only the blocknumber.tx_id appearances of the exported transactions
  -x, --fmt string      export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose         enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help            display this help screen

#### Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --dollars         export values in US dollars
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
