// chifra receipts returns the given transaction's receipt. You may specify multiple transaction identifiers per invocation. The --articulate option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract (including those encountered in a trace--if the --trace option is enabled) to better describe the reported data. Generally speaking, this tool is less useful than others as you may report the same data using chifra transactions and more focused data using chifra logs. It is included here for completeness, as the receipt is a fundamental data structure in Ethereum.
