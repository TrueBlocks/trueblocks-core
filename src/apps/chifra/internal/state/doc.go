// The chifra state tool retrieves the balance of an address (or list of addresses) at the given block (or blocks). Specify multiple addresses and/or multiple blocks if you wish, but you must specify at least one address. If no block is specified, the latest block is reported. You may also query to see if an address is a smart contract as well as retrieve a contract's byte code.
