## chifra list

`chifra list` takes one or more addresses, queries the index of appearances, and builds TrueBlocks monitors. A TrueBlocks monitor is a file that contains blockNumber.transactionId pairs (transaction identifiers) representing the history of the address.

Because TrueBlocks only extracts data from the Ethereum node when it's requested, the first time you list an address it takes about a minute. Subsequent queries are much faster because TrueBlocks caches the results.

Note that `chifra list` only queries the index, it does not extract the full transactional details. You may use `chifra export` for that.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  List every appearance of an address anywhere on the chain.

Usage:
  chifra list [flags] <address> [address...]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses (0x...) to list (required)

Flags:
  -U, --count        display only the count of records for each monitor
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help         display this help screen

Notes:
  - No other options are permitted when --silent is selected.
```

#### Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
