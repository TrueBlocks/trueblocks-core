Folders to remove
	Anything of our cache names in the top level cache
	Any of our five folders in unchained
	Any thing in the top level other than
		trueBlocks.toml
		cache folder
		abis folder
		config folder
		unchained folder


	- [ ] Docs
  - [ ] ./docs/content/chifra/configs.md needs work
  - [ ] Must document running against private networks and how one must configure the scraper for smaller chunks
  - [ ] Make a note in the docs of where things fall short - uniswap, no index other than a,b,c chains
  - [ ] Make a note in docs about what is and what is not indexed by us
  - [ ] We need to document the way these paths work in the website (search for XDG to find out where)

### Steps to Migrate
---
- [x] The CheckMigrations routine should fail if the migration isn't complete
- [x] Some of the `cmake` files and the `make install` may need to be modified.
- [x] Some of the files and scripts in `build_assets` may have to be re-worked
- [x] Add `chain` to the `status` endpoints
- [x] Finish the migrations-0.25.0.md file
- [x] Re-write the `trueBlocks.toml` file with version `0.25.0`. 
  - [ ] Use this as one of the markers that the installation is completed. 

### What We Need to Control
---
There are three values we need to control:

- Where is the `trueBlocks.toml` file?
  - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/trueblocks/trueBlocks.toml`, if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not empty
  - `$HOME/.local/share/trueblocks/trueBlocks.toml`, on Linux
  - `$HOME/Library/Application Support/TrueBlocks/trueBlocks.toml`, on Mac
  - Call this folder `TB_HOME`

- How do we get the value of `chain`?
  - Command line option only (this is already there)
  - Value is sent to C++ code in an environment variable
  - if empty, set it to default `mainnet`
  - call this value `CHAIN`

- Where are chain specific configurations?
  - Only two configurations are not chain specific:
    - `trueBlocks.toml` file and 
    - `known` abi files (which remain correct even accross chains)
    - Always find these at `$TB_HOME/`
  - Otherwise chain specific configs are found at `$TB_HOME/config/$CHAIN/`
  - Example: `$TB_HOME/config/main net/blockScrape.toml`
  - Users may place a config file at `$TB_HOME`. If found, it will be read first and chain-specific values will be 'overlayed' if present or appended if not.

- Where are the chain-specific caches?
  - All caches are chain specific
  - If there is a value at `[settings]cachePath=` in the `trueBlocks.toml`
    - Use it
    - if the value does not end with `/cache/$CHAIN`
      - Remove `cache` if present
      - Append `cache/$CHAIN`
  - If the value of `cachePath` is empty
    - Set `$CACHE_PATH` to `$TB_HOME/cache/$CHAIN/`
  - Create `$CACHE_PATH` if it does not exist
  - Invariant: 
    - `$CACHE_PATH` exists
    - `$CACHE_PATH` ends with `cache/$CHAIN`
  - If above is true, establish all the subcaches

- Where is the unchained index (all indexes are chain-specific)
  - Identically calculated to `cachePath`, but exchange `cache` for `unchained`.

- For all of the above folders, create the folder if it doesn't exist

### Rules for checking proper migration in GoLang code
---
- If the version of `trueBlocks.toml` is `0.25.0` or later, we don't need to check any previous migrations
- If the `$TB_HOME` contains any of the following folders, fail.
  - `cache`, `mocked`, `manifest`, `unchained`, `ts.bin.gz`, `poloniex.tar.gz`
  - Tell the user to complete the migration and quit

- If the `$TB_HOME` contains any `toml` file other than `trueBlocks.toml` 
  - Tell them to move them to the chain-specific config and quit

- The installer will install a few config files on first build:
  - If there is no `$TB_HOME/abis` folder, fail
  - If there is no `$TB_HOME/config`, fail
  - If there is no `$TB_HOME/config/mainnet`, fail
  - If there is no `$TB_HOME/config/mainnet/manifest/`, fail
  - Would be amazing if the rest of the configuration for a chain could be found in the manifest
  - Alt: If there is no `$TB_HOME/config/mainnet/names/`, fail
  - Alt: If there is no `$TB_HOME/config/mainnet/allocs/`, fail
