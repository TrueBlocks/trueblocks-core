Notes:
  - The transactions list may be one or more space-separated identifiers which are either a transaction hash, a blockNumber.transactionID pair, or a blockHash.transactionID pair, or any combination.
  - This tool checks for valid input syntax, but does not check that the transaction requested actually exists.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results for most older transactions are undefined.`
