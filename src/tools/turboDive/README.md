## chifra dive

`chifra dive` is a simple tool that dives into the details of the TurboGeth database. It is not really ready for prime time, so please use with caution.

#### Other Options

All **TrueBlocks** command-line tools support the following commands (although in some case, they have no meaning):

    Command     |     Description
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    --version   |   display the current version of the tool
    --nocolor   |   turn off colored display
    --wei       |   specify value in wei (the default)
    --ether     |   specify value in ether
    --dollars   |   specify value in US dollars
    --raw       |   report JSON data from the node with minimal processing
    --very_raw  |   report JSON data from node with zero processing
    --fmt       |   export format (where appropriate). One of [none|txt|csv|json|api]
    --to_file   |   write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
    --output:fn |   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
    --file:fn   |   specify multiple sets of command line options in a file.

<small>*For the `--file:fn` option, place a series of valid command lines in a file and use the above options. In some cases, this option may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of a line makes that line a comment.*</small>
