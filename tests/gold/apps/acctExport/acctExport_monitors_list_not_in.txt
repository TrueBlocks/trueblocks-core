  -d, --commands string    available with --watch option only, the file containing the list of commands to apply to each watched address
  -b, --batch_size uint    available with --watch option only, the number of monitors to process in each batch (default 8)
  -u, --run_count uint     available with --watch option only, run the monitor this many times, then quit

Notes:
  - An address must be either an ENS name or start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - If no address is presented to the --clean command, all existing monitors will be cleaned.
  - The --watch option requires two additional parameters to be specified: --watchlist and --commands.
  - Addresses provided on the command line are ignored in --watch mode.
  - Providing the value existing to the --watchlist monitors all existing monitor files (see --list).
