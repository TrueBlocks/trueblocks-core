1	1606824028	2020-12-01 12:00:28 UTC	beacon_genesis	beacon	The Beacon Chain needed 16384 deposits of 32 staked ETH to ship securely. This happened on November 27&#44; meaning the Beacon Chain started producing blocks on December 1&#44; 2020. This is an important first step in achieving the Ethereum vision.
74240	1635332183	2021-10-27 10:56:23 UTC	altair	beacon	The Altair upgrade was the first scheduled upgrade for the Beacon Chain. It added support for sync committees—enabling light clients&#44; and increased validator inactivity and slashing penalties as development progressed towards The Merge.
144896	1662464087	2022-09-06 11:34:47 UTC	bellatrix	beacon	The Bellatrix upgrade was the second scheduled upgrade for the Beacon Chain&#44; preparing the chain for The Merge. It brings validator penalties to their full values for inactivity and slashable offenses. Bellatrix also includes an update to the fork choice rules to prepare the chain for The Merge and the transition from the last proof-of-work block to the first proof-of-stake block. This includes making consensus clients aware of the terminal total difficulty of 58750000000000000000000.
194048	1681338455	2023-04-12 22:27:35 UTC	capella	beacon	The Capella upgrade was the third major upgrade to the consensus layer (Beacon Chain) and enabled staking withdrawals. Capella occurred synchronously with the execution layer upgrade&#44; Shanghai&#44; and enabled staking withdrawal functionality. This consensus layer upgrade brought the ability for stakers who did not provide withdrawal credentials with their initial deposit to do so&#44; thereby enabling withdrawals. The upgrade also provided automatic account sweeping functionality&#44; which continuously processes validator accounts for any available rewards payments or full withdrawals.
0	1438269975	2015-07-30 15:26:15 UTC	frontier	execution	Frontier was a live&#44; but barebone implementation of the Ethereum project. It followed the successful Olympic testing phase. It was intended for technical users&#44; specifically developers. Blocks had a gas limit of 5&#44;000. This ‘thawing’ period enabled miners to start their operations and for early adopters to install their clients without having to ‘rush’.

200000	1441661589	2015-09-07 21:33:09 UTC	iceage	execution	The frontier thawing fork lifted the 5&#44;000 gas limit per block and set the default gas price to 51 gwei. This allowed for transactions – transactions require 21&#44;000 gas. The difficulty bomb was introduced to ensure a future hard-fork to proof-of-stake.

1920000	1469020840	2016-07-20 13:20:40 UTC	daofork	execution	The DAO fork was in response to the 2016 DAO attack where an insecure DAO contract was drained of over 3.6 million ETH in a hack. The fork moved the funds from the faulty contract to a new contract with a single function: withdraw. Anyone who lost funds could withdraw 1 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens in their wallets. This course of action was voted on by the Ethereum community. Any ETH holder was able to vote via a transaction on a voting platform. The decision to fork reached over 85% of the votes. Some miners refused to fork because the DAO incident wasn't a defect in the protocol. They went on to form Ethereum Classic.

9200000	1577953849	2020-01-02 08:30:49 UTC	muir_glacier	execution	The Muir Glacier fork introduced a delay to the difficulty bomb. Increases in block difficulty of the proof-of-work consensus mechanism threatened to degrade the usability of Ethereum by increasing wait times for sending transactions and using dapps.
11052984	1602667372	2020-10-14 09:22:52 UTC	deposit_contract	execution	The staking deposit contract introduced staking to the Ethereum ecosystem. Although a Mainnet contract&#44; it had a direct impact on the timeline for launching the Beacon Chain&#44; an important Ethereum upgrade.

12965000	1628166822	2021-08-05 12:33:42 UTC	london	execution	The London upgrade introduced EIP-1559 &#44; which reformed the transaction fee market&#44; along with changes to how gas refunds are handled and the Ice Age schedule.
13773000	1639079723	2021-12-09 19:55:23 UTC	arrow_glacier	execution	The Arrow Glacier network upgrade pushed back the difficulty bomb by several months. This is the only change introduced in this upgrade&#44; and is similar in nature to the Muir Glacier upgrade. Similar changes have been performed on the Byzantium&#44; Constantinople and London network upgrades.
15050000	1656586444	2022-06-30 10:54:04 UTC	gray_glacier	execution	The Gray Glacier network upgrade pushed back the difficulty bomb by three months. This is the only change introduced in this upgrade&#44; and is similar in nature to the Arrow Glacier and Muir Glacier upgrades. Similar changes have been performed on the Byzantium&#44; Constantinople and London network upgrades.
15537393	1663224162	2022-09-15 06:42:42 UTC	paris_merge	execution	The Paris upgrade was triggered by the proof-of-work blockchain passing a terminal total difficulty of 58750000000000000000000. This happened at block 15537393 on 15th September 2022&#44; triggering the Paris upgrade the next block. Paris was The Merge transition - its major feature was switching off the proof-of-work mining algorithm and associated consensus logic and switching on proof-of-stake instead. Paris itself was an upgrade to the execution clients (equivalent to Bellatrix on the consensus layer) that enabled them to take instruction from their connected consensus clients. This required a new set of internal API methods&#44; collectively known as the Engine API&#44; to be activated. This was arguably the most significant upgrade in Ethereum history since Homestead!
17034870	1681338479	2023-04-12 22:27:59 UTC	shanghai	execution	The Shanghai upgrade brought staking withdrawals to the execution layer. In tandem with the Capella upgrade&#44; this enabled blocks to accept withdrawal operations&#44; which allows stakers to withdraw their ETH from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer.
19426587	1710338135	2024-03-13 13:55:35 UTC	dencun	execution	Also called Cancun-Deneb includes EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) through data blobs
