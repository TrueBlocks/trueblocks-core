chifra state  --help --verbose
Purpose:
  Retrieve account balance(s) for one or more addresses at given block(s).

Usage:
  chifra state [flags] <address> [address...] [block...]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses (0x...) from which to retrieve balances (required)
  blocks - an optional list of one or more blocks at which to report balances, defaults to 'latest'

Flags:
  -p, --parts strings      control which state to export
                           One or more of [ balance | nonce | code | proxy | deployed | accttype | some | all ]
  -c, --changes            only report a balance when it changes from one block to the next
  -z, --no_zero            suppress the display of zero balance accounts
  -l, --call               write-only call (a query) to a smart contract
  -s, --send               writes a transaction to an address (see docs for more information) (hidden)
  -d, --calldata string    for commands (--call or --send), provides the call data (in various forms) for the command (may be empty for --send)
  -a, --articulate         for commands only, articulate the retrieved data if ABIs can be found
  -r, --proxy_for string   for commands only, redirects calls to this implementation
  -H, --ether              specify value in ether
  -o, --cache              force the results of the query into the cache
  -D, --decache            removes related items from the cache
  -x, --fmt string         export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose            enable verbose output
  -h, --help               display this help screen

Notes:
  - An address must be either an ENS name or start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - Blocks is a space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined.
  - Special blocks are detailed under chifra when --list.
  - Balance is the default mode. To select a single mode use none first, followed by that mode.
  - Valid parameters for --calldata include Solidity-like syntax: balanceOf(0x316b...), a four-byte followed by parameters: 0x70a08231(0x316b...), or encoded input data.
  - You may specify multiple parts on a single line.
  - In the --call string, you may separate multiple calls with a colon.
  - Your use of the unaudited --send option legally absolves TrueBlocks, LLC or any associated parties from liability or loss related to such use.
  - The --send option does not validate its input before sending your transaction to the network. If you provide invalid data, you may lose your funds. Be warned.
  - As of version 4.0.0, use --call --calldata <cmd> to provide your command.
  - --calldata may be one or more colon-separated solidity calls, four-byte plus parameters, or encoded call data strings.
