#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in QBlocks**, contact us through our website instead.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/quickBlocks/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/quickBlocks/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read [Contributing](http://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/quickBlocks/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of QBlocks will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in our [slack channel](http://quickblocks.slack.com) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use QBlocks in the [slack channel](http://quickblocks.slack.com).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

We encourage you to pitch in and [slack channel](http://quickblocks.slack.com)!
