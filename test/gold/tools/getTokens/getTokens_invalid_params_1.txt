Error: You must specify at least two address
Usage:
  chifra tokens [flags] <address> <address> [address...] [block...]

Arguments:
  addrs - two or more addresses (0x...), the first is an ERC20 token, balances for the rest are reported (required)
  blocks - an optional list of one or more blocks at which to report balances, defaults to 'latest'

Flags:
  -p, --parts strings   which parts of the token information to retrieve
                        One or more of [ name | symbol | decimals | totalSupply | version | all ]
  -b, --by_acct         consider each address an ERC20 token except the last, whose balance is reported for each token
  -c, --changes         only report a balance when it changes from one block to the next
  -n, --no_zero         suppress the display of zero balance accounts
  -x, --fmt string      export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose         enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help            display this help screen

Notes:
  - An address must be either an ENS name or start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - Blocks is a space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination.
  - If the token contract(s) from which you request balances are not ERC20 compliant, the results are undefined.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined.
  - Special blocks are detailed under chifra when --list.
  - If the --parts option is not empty, all addresses are considered tokens and each token's attributes are presented.
