Arguments:
  addrs - two or more addresses (0x...), the first is an ERC20 token, balances for the rest are reported (required)
  blocks - an optional list of one or more blocks at which to report balances, defaults to 'latest'

Flags:
  -p, --parts strings   which parts of the token information to retrieve
                        One or more of name, symbol, decimals, totalSupply, version, none, all
  -b, --by_acct         consider each address an ERC20 token except the last, whose balance is reported for each token
  -n, --no_zero         suppress the display of zero balance accounts

Global Flags:
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -h, --help         display this help screen
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)

Notes:
  - An address must start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - blocks may be a space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination.
  - If the token contract(s) from which you request balances are not ERC20 compliant, the results are undefined.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined.
  - special blocks are detailed under chifra when --list.
