  Invalid option: -fmt. Did you mean --fmt?

Purpose:
  Retrieve one or more transactions from the chain or local cache.

Usage:
  getTrans [flags] <tx_id> [tx_id...]

Arguments:
  transactions - a space-separated list of one or more transaction identifiers (required)

Flags:
  -a, --articulate            articulate the retrieved data if ABIs can be found
  -t, --trace                 include the transaction's traces in the results
  -u, --uniq                  display a list of uniq addresses found in the transaction instead of the underlying data
  -r, --reconcile <address>   reconcile the transaction as per the provided address
  -o, --cache                 force the results of the query into the tx cache (and the trace cache if applicable)

Global Flags:
  -x, --fmt string     export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose uint   set verbose level (optional level defaults to 1)
  -h, --help           display this help screen

Notes:
  - The transactions list may be one or more space-separated identifiers which are either a transaction hash, a blockNumber.transactionID pair, or a blockHash.transactionID pair, or any combination.
  - This tool checks for valid input syntax, but does not check that the transaction requested actually exists.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results for most older transactions are undefined.
