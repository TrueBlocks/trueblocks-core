  Usage:    getTokenInfo [-b|-n|-v|-h] <address> <address> [address...] [block...]  
  Purpose:  Retrieve the token balance(s) for one or more addresses at the given (or latest) block(s).

  Where:  
	addr_list             two or more addresses (0x...), the first is an ERC20 token, balances for the rest are reported (required)
	block_list            an optional list of one or more blocks at which to report balances, defaults to 'latest'
	-b  (--by_acct)       consider each address an ERC20 token except the last, whose balance is reported for each token
	-n  (--no_zero)       suppress the display of zero balance accounts

	-i  (--info enum[name|decimals|totalSupply|version|symbol|all])retreive information [name|decimals|totalSupply|version|symbol|all] about the token

	-v  (--verbose)       set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level
	-h  (--help)          display this help screen

  Notes:
	- addresses must start with '0x' and be forty two characters long.
	- block_list may be a space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination.
	- This tool retrieves information from the local node or rpcProvider if configured (see documentation).
	- If the token contract(s) from which you request balances are not ERC20 compliant, the results are undefined.
	- If the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined.
	- special blocks are detailed under whenBlock --list.
