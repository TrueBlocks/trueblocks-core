Notes:
  - An address must start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - blocks may be a space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined.
  - special blocks are detailed under chifra when --list.
  - balance is the default mode. To select a single mode use none first, followed by that mode.
  - You may specify multiple modes on a single line.
