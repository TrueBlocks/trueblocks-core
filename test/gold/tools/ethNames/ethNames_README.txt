`Notes:`

- With a single search term, the tool searches both `name` and `address`.
- With two search terms, the first term must match the `address` field, and the second term must match the `name` field.
- When there are two search terms, both must match.
- The `--match_case` option requires case sensitive matching. It works with all other options.
- To customize the list of names add a `custom` section to the config file (see documentation).
