      "description": "Frontier was a live\u0026#44; but barebone implementation of the Ethereum project. It followed the successful Olympic testing phase. It was intended for technical users\u0026#44; specifically developers. Blocks had a gas limit of 5\u0026#44;000. This ‘thawing’ period enabled miners to start their operations and for early adopters to install their clients without having to ‘rush’.",
