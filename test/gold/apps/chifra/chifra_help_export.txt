chifra  export --help --log_level 2
Purpose:
  Export full detail of transactions for one or more addresses.

Usage:
  chifra export [flags] <address> [address...] [topics...] [fourbytes...]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses (0x...) to export (required)
  topics - filter by one or more log topics (only for --logs option)
  fourbytes - filter by one or more fourbytes (only for transactions and trace options)

Flags:
  -p, --appearances           export a list of appearances
  -r, --receipts              export receipts instead of transactional data
  -l, --logs                  export logs instead of transactional data
  -t, --traces                export traces instead of transactional data
  -A, --statements            export reconciliations instead of transactional data (requires --accounting option)
  -n, --neighbors             export the neighbors of the given address
  -C, --accounting            attach accounting records to the exported data (applies to transactions export only)
  -a, --articulate            articulate transactions, traces, logs, and outputs
  -i, --cache                 write transactions to the cache (see notes)
  -R, --cache_traces          write traces to the cache (see notes)
  -y, --factory               scan for contract creations from the given address(es) and report address of those contracts
  -U, --count                 only available for --appearances mode, if present, return only the number of records
  -c, --first_record uint     the first record to process
  -e, --max_records uint      the maximum number of records to process before reporting (default 250)
      --relevant              for log and accounting export only, export only logs relevant to one of the given export addresses
      --emitter strings       for log export only, export only logs if emitted by one of these address(es)
      --topic strings         for log export only, export only logs with this topic(s)
      --clean                 clean (i.e. remove duplicate appearances) from all existing monitors
  -f, --freshen               freshen but do not print the exported data (hidden)
  -s, --staging               enable search of staging (not yet finalized) folder (hidden)
  -u, --unripe                enable search of unripe (neither staged nor finalized) folder (assumes --staging) (hidden)
      --load string           a comma separated list of dynamic traversers to load (hidden)
      --reversed              produce results in reverse chronological order (hidden)
  -b, --by_date               produce results sorted by date (report by address otherwise) (hidden)
  -z, --summarize_by string   for --accounting only, summarize reconciliations by this time period (hidden)
                              One of [ yearly | quarterly | monthly | weekly | daily | hourly | blockly | tx ]
  -D, --deep                  for --neighbors option only, dig deeply into detail (otherwise, to and from only) (hidden)
  -d, --skip_ddos             toggle skipping over 2016 dDos transactions ('on' by default) (hidden)
  -m, --max_traces uint       if --skip_ddos is on, this many traces defines what a ddos transaction is (hidden) (default 250)
  -F, --first_block uint      first block to process (inclusive) (hidden)
  -L, --last_block uint       last block to process (inclusive) (hidden)
  -x, --fmt string            export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose               enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help                  display this help screen

Notes:
  - An address must start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - Articulating the export means turn the EVM's byte data into human-readable text (if possible).
  - For the --logs option, you may optionally specify one or more --emmitter, one or more --topics, or both.
  - The --logs option is significantly faster if you provide an --emitter or a --topic.
  - Neighbors include every address that appears in any transaction in which the export address also appears.
