PROG_NAME = [chifra traces]

  Usage:    chifra traces [-a|-f|-d|-c|-v|-h] <tx_id> [tx_id...]
  Purpose:  Retrieve traces for the given transaction(s).

  Where:
    transactions          a space-separated list of one or more transaction identifiers (required)
    -a  (--articulate)    articulate the retrieved data if ABIs can be found
    -f  (--filter <str>)  call the node's trace_filter routine with bang-seperated filter
    -d  (--statediff)     export state diff traces (not implemented)
    -c  (--count)         show the number of traces for the transaction only (fast)

    #### Hidden options
    -s  (--skip_ddos)     skip over the 2016 ddos during export ('on' by default)
    -m  (--max <num>)     if --skip_ddos is on, this many traces defines what a ddos transaction is (default = 250)
    #### Hidden options

    -x  (--fmt <val>)     export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
    -v  (--verbose)       set verbose level (optional level defaults to 1)
    -h  (--help)          display this help screen

  Notes:
    - The transactions list may be one or more space-separated identifiers which are either a transaction hash,
      a blockNumber.transactionID pair, or a blockHash.transactionID pair, or any combination.
    - This tool checks for valid input syntax, but does not check that the transaction requested actually exists.
    - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results for most older transactions are undefined.
    - A bang seperated filter has the following fields (at least one of which is required) and is separated
      with a bang (!): fromBlk, toBlk, fromAddr, toAddr, after, count.
    - A state diff trace describes, for each modified address, what changed during that trace.

  Configurable Items:
    - skip_ddos: skip over the 2016 ddos during export ('on' by default).
    - max: if --skip_ddos is on, this many traces defines what a ddos transaction is (default = 250).
