chifra  traces --help --log_level 2
Purpose:
  Retrieve traces for the given transaction(s).

Usage:
  chifra traces [flags] <tx_id> [tx_id...]

Arguments:
  transactions - a space-separated list of one or more transaction identifiers (required)

Flags:
  -a, --articulate      articulate the retrieved data if ABIs can be found
  -f, --filter string   call the node's trace_filter routine with bang-separated filter
  -d, --statediff       export state diff traces (not implemented)
  -c, --count           show the number of traces for the transaction only (fast)
  -s, --skip_ddos       skip over the 2016 ddos during export ('on' by default) (hidden)
  -m, --max uint        if --skip_ddos is on, this many traces defines what a ddos transaction is (hidden) (default 250)
  -x, --fmt string      export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose         enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help            display this help screen

Notes:
  - The transactions list may be one or more transaction hashes, blockNumber.transactionID pairs, or a blockHash.transactionID pairs.
  - This tool checks for valid input syntax, but does not check that the transaction requested actually exists.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results for most older transactions are undefined.
  - A bang separated filter has the following fields (at least one of which is required) and is separated with a bang (!): fromBlk, toBlk, fromAddr, toAddr, after, count.
  - A state diff trace describes, for each modified address, what changed during that trace.
