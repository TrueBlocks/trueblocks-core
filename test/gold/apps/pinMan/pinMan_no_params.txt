chifra pins  
Purpose:
  Manage pinned index of appearances and associated blooms.

Usage:
  pinMan [flags]

Flags:
  -l, --list             list the bloom and index hashes from local cache or IPFS
  -i, --init             download the blooms or index chunks from IPFS
  -f, --freshen          check for new bloom or index chunks and download if available (alias for --init)
  -a, --all              in addition to Bloom filters, download full index chunks as well
  -S, --share            share downloaded data by pinning it to IPFS (the IPFS daemon must be running)
  -r, --remote           for --list mode only, recover the manifest from IPFS via UnchainedIndex smart contract
  -s, --sleep <double>   throttle requests by this many seconds (.25 seconds delay between requests by default)

Global Flags:
  -x, --fmt string     export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose uint   set verbose level (optional level defaults to 1)
  -h, --help           display this help screen

Notes:
  - One of --list, --init, or --freshen is required.
  - The --share option only works if the IPFS executable is in your path.
  - The --freshen option is an alias of --init.
  - Re-run chifra init as often as you wish. It will correct previously interrupted downloads and freshen.
