Notes:
  - An address must be either an ENS name or start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - If no address is presented to the --clean command, all monitors will be cleaned.
  - The --watch option requires the --file option which specifies the command file to apply.
  - The --watch option looks for a local file called address.csv (.txt). If not found, all existing monitors will be watched.
