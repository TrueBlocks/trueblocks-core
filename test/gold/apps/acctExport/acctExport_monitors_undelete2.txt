Notes:
  - An address must be either an ENS name or start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - If no address is presented to the --clean command, all existing monitors will be cleaned.
  - The --watch option requires two additional parameters to be specified: --watchlist and --commands.
  - Addresses provided on the command line are ignored in --watch mode.
  - Providing the value existing to the --watchlist monitors all existing monitor files (see --list).
