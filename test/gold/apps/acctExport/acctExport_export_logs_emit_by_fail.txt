  The --emitter option is only available when exporting logs. Quitting...

Purpose:
  Export full detail of transactions for one or more addresses.

Usage:
  acctExport [flags] <address> [address...] [topics] [fourbytes]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses (0x...) to export (required)
  topics - filter by one or more log topics (only for --logs option)
  fourbytes - filter by one or more fourbytes (only for transactions and trace options)

Flags:
  -p, --appearances          export a list of appearances
  -r, --receipts             export receipts instead of transactional data
  -l, --logs                 export logs instead of transactional data
  -t, --traces               export traces instead of transactional data
  -A, --statements           export reconciliations instead of transactional data (requires --accounting option)
  -n, --neighbors            export the neighbors of the given address
  -C, --accounting           attach accounting records to the exported data (applies to transactions export only)
  -a, --articulate           articulate transactions, traces, logs, and outputs
  -i, --cache                write transactions to the cache (see notes)
  -R, --cache_traces         write traces to the cache (see notes)
  -y, --factory              scan for contract creations from the given address(es) and report address of those contracts
  -U, --count                only available for --appearances mode, if present, return only the number of records
  -c, --first_record <num>   the first record to process
  -e, --max_records <num>    the maximum number of records to process before reporting
      --relevant             for log and accounting export only, export only logs relevant to one of the given export addresses
      --emitter string       for log export only, export only logs if emitted by one of these address(es)
      --topic string         for log export only, export only logs with this topic(s)
      --asset string         for the statements option only, export only reconciliations for this asset
      --clean                clean (i.e. remove duplicate appearances) from all existing monitors
  -f, --freshen              freshen but do not print the exported data (hidden)
  -s, --staging              export transactions labeled staging (i.e. older than 28 blocks but not yet consolidated)
  -u, --unripe               export transactions labeled upripe (i.e. less than 28 blocks old)
      --load string          a comma separated list of dynamic traversers to load (hidden)
      --reversed             produce results in reverse chronological order (hidden)
  -b, --by_date              produce results sorted by date (report by address otherwise) (hidden)
  -z, --summarize_by <val>   for --accounting only, summarize reconciliations by this time period, one of [yearly|quarterly|monthly|weekly|daily|hourly|blockly|tx] (hidden)
  -D, --deep                 for --neighbors option only, dig deeply into detail (otherwise, to and from only) (hidden)
  -F, --first_block <num>    first block to process (inclusive)
  -L, --last_block <num>     last block to process (inclusive)
      --delete               delete a monitor, but do not remove it
      --undelete             undelete a previously deleted monitor
      --remove               remove a previously deleted monitor

Global Flags:
  -x, --fmt string     export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose uint   set verbose level (optional level defaults to 1)
  -h, --help           display this help screen

Notes:
  - An address must start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - Articulating the export means turn the EVM's byte data into human-readable text (if possible).
  - For the --logs option, you may optionally specify one or more --emmitter, one or more --topics, or both.
  - The --logs option is significantly faster if you provide an --emitter or a --topic.
  - Neighbors include every address that appears in any transaction in which the export address also appears.
