chifra export  --file cmd_file_2 --bad
Error: 
  unknown flag: --bad

Usage:
  chifra export [flags] <address> [address...] [topics...] [fourbytes...]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses (0x...) to export (required)
  topics - filter by one or more log topics (only for --logs option)
  fourbytes - filter by one or more fourbytes (only for transactions and trace options)

Flags:
  -p, --appearances         export a list of appearances
  -r, --receipts            export receipts instead of transactional data
  -l, --logs                export logs instead of transactional data
  -t, --traces              export traces instead of transactional data
  -n, --neighbors           export the neighbors of the given address
  -C, --accounting          attach accounting records to the exported data (applies to transactions export only)
  -A, --statements          for the accounting options only, export only statements
  -a, --articulate          articulate transactions, traces, logs, and outputs
  -i, --cache               write transactions to the cache (see notes)
  -R, --cache_traces        write traces to the cache (see notes)
  -U, --count               only available for --appearances mode, if present, return only the number of records
  -c, --first_record uint   the first record to process
  -e, --max_records uint    the maximum number of records to process before reporting (default 250)
      --relevant            for log and accounting export only, export only logs relevant to one of the given export addresses
      --emitter strings     for log export only, export only logs if emitted by one of these address(es)
      --topic strings       for log export only, export only logs with this topic(s)
      --asset strings       for the accounting options only, export statements only for this asset
  -f, --flow string         for the accounting options only, export statements with incoming, outgoing, or zero value
                            One of [ in | out | zero ]
  -y, --factory             scan for contract creations from the given address(es) and report address of those contracts
  -u, --unripe              export transactions labeled upripe (i.e. less than 28 blocks old)
      --load string         a comma separated list of dynamic traversers to load (hidden)
      --reversed            produce results in reverse chronological order (hidden)
  -F, --first_block uint    first block to process (inclusive)
  -L, --last_block uint     last block to process (inclusive)
  -x, --fmt string          export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose             enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help                display this help screen

Notes:
  - An address must start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - Articulating the export means turn the EVM's byte data into human-readable text (if possible).
  - For the --logs option, you may optionally specify one or more --emitter, one or more --topics, or both.
  - The --logs option is significantly faster if you provide an --emitter or a --topic.
  - Neighbors include every address that appears in any transaction in which the export address also appears.
