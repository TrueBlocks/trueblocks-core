## chifra monitors

A TrueBlocks monitor is simply a file on your computer that represents the transactional history of a given Ethereum address. Monitors do not exist until you indicate your interest in a certain address. (See `chifra list`.)

You may use the `--delete` command to delete (or undelete if already deleted) an address. The monitor is not removed from your computer if you delete it. It is just marked as deleted making it invisible to the TrueBlocks explorer.

Use the `--remove` command to permanently remove a monitor from your computer. This is an irreversible operation.
