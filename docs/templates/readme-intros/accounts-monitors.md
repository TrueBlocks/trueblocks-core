`[{NAME}]` has two purposes: (1) to display information about the current set of monitors, and (2)
to `--watch` a set of addresses. The `--watch` function allows one to "follow" an address (or set
of addresses) and keep an off-chain database fresh.

### Crud commands

`chifra list` creates a new monitor. See that tool's help file for more information.

The `chifra monitors --delete` command deletes (or `--undelete` if already deleted) an address but does not remove it from your hard drive. The monitor is marked as being deleted, making it invisible to other tools.

Use the `--remove` command to permanently remove a monitor from your computer. This is an
irreversible operation and requires the monitor to have been previously deleted.

The `--decache` option will remove not only the monitor but all of the cached data associated with
the monitor (for example, transactions or traces). This is an irreversible operation (except
for the fact that the cache can be easily re-created with `chifra list <address>`). The monitor need not have been previously deleted.

### Watching addresses

The `--watch` command is special. It starts a long-running process that continually reads the blockchain looking for appearances of the addresses it is instructed to watch. It command requires two additional parameters: `--watchlist <filename>` and `--commands <filename>`.  The `--watchlist` file is simply a list of addresses or ENS names, one per line:

```
0x5e349eca2dc61abcd9dd99ce94d04136151a09ee
trueblocks.eth
0x855b26bc8ebabcdbefe82ee5e9d40d20a1a4c11f
etc.
```

You may monitor as many addresses as you wish, however, if the commands you specify take longer than the `--sleep` amount you specify (14 seconds by default), the results are undefined. (Adjust `--sleep` if necessary.)

The `--commands` file may contain a list of any valid `chifra` command that operates on addresses. (Currently `export`, `list`, `state`, `tokens`.) Each command in the `--commands` file is executed once for each address in the `--watchlist` file. The `--commands` file may contain any number of commands, one per line with the above proviso. For example:

```
chifra list [{ADDRESS}]
chifra export --logs [{ADDRESS}]
etc.
```

The `[{ADDRESS}]` token is a stand-in for all addresses in the `--watchlist`. Addresses are processed in groups of `batch_size` (default 8).

Invalid commands or invalid addresses are ignored. If a command fails, the process continues with the next command. If a command fails for a particular address, the process continues with the next address. A warning is generated.
