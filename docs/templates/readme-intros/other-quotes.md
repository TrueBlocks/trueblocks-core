## [{NAME}]

The `[{NAME}]` tool provides USD ($) price data to other tools and to the command line. Currently, `[{NAME}]` retrieves its price data from the Poloniex API. In future versions, we will add other sources and provide a mechanism for fair averaging. Ultimately, as more of this type of price data becomes available on chain, we will use those source, but this is not yet implemented.
