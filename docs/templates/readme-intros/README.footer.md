#### Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

| Command     | Description                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --version   | display the current version of the tool                       |
| --wei       | export values in wei (the default)                            |
| --ether     | export values in ether                                        |
| --dollars   | export values in US dollars                                   |
| --raw       | pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing   |
| --to_file   | write the results to a temporary file and return the filename |
| --output fn | write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename        |
| --file fn   | specify multiple sets of command line options in a file       |

<small>*For the `--file fn` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any of the above flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes that line a comment.*</small>
