The `[{NAME}]` application creates TrueBlocks' chunked index of address appearances -- the
fundamental data structure of the entire system. It also, optionally, pins each chunk of the index
to IPFS.

`[{NAME}]` is a long running process, therefore we advise you run it as a service or in terminal
multiplexer such as `tmux`. You may start and stop `[{NAME}]` as needed, but doing so means the
scraper will not be keeping up with the front of the blockchain. The next time it starts, it will
have to catch up to the chain, a process that may take several hours depending on how long ago it
was last run. See the section below and the "Papers" section of our website for more information
on how the scraping process works and prerequisites for it proper operation.

You may adjust the speed of the index creation with the `--sleep` and `--block_cnt` options. On
some machines, or when running against some EVM node software, the scraper may overburden the
hardware. Slowing things down will ensure proper operation. Finally, you may optionally `--pin`
each new chunk to IPFS which naturally shards the database among all users. By default, pinning
is against a locally running IPFS node, but the `--remote` option allows pinning to an IPFS
pinning service such as Pinata.
