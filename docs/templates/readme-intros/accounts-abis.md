## [{NAME}]

`[{NAME}]` retrieves a smart contract's ABI file either from the current local folder, from the TrueBlocks cache, from [Etherscan](http://etherscan.io), or (in the future) from ENS and Sourcify.

While this tool may be used from the command line or the API, its primary use is in support of the `--articulate` option of other tools such as `chifra export`.

The `--known` option prints a list of standard and semi-standard function signatures such as the ERC20 standard, various OpenZeppelin functions, the base and pair Uniswap functions, etc.

The `--find` option is experimental. It scans a cross of approx. 100,000 function names with approx. 700 function signatures, generating at each cross a four byte signature and looking for a match to the provided fourbyte. Very infrequently, this tool will find a match for an otherwise unknown fourbyte string.

The `--sol` option will convert a single Solidity file found in the current folder into an ABI.
