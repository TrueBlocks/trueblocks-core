## [{NAME}]

The `[{NAME}]` program allows you to manage the various TrueBlocks caches. You may list all of the caches, some of the cache, or even individual caches either in terse or full detail. The cache of interest is specified with the `modes` option.

TrueBlocks maintains caches for the index of address appearances, named addresses, abi files, as well as other data including blockchain data, address monitors, and groups of address monitors called collections.
