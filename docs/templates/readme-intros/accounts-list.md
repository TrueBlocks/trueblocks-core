## chifra list

`chifra list` takes one or more addresses, queries the index of appearances, and builds TrueBlocks monitors. A TrueBlocks monitor is a file that contains blockNumber.transactionId pairs (transaction identifiers) representing the history of the address.

Becuase TrueBlocks only extracts data from the Ethereum node when it's requested, the first time you list an address it takes about a minute. Subsequent queries are much faster because TrueBlocks caches the results.

Note that `chifra list` only queries the index, it does not extract the full transactional details. You may use `chifra export` for that.
