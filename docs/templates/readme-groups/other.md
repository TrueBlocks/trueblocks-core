These commands call some useful miscellaneous tools:

- `chifra explore` a quick way to open a blockchain explorer,
- `ethslurp` an older tool that lets you call data from EtherScan. (This has issues of centralization and data quality, see explanation in its section).

Note: some of these tools, like `ethslurp`, require an EtherScan key. [Follow these instructions to add a key to
your config](/docs/install/install-trueblocks/#3-update-the-configs-for-your-rpc-and-api-keys)
