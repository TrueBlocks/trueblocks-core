The Admin component allows you to query the status of the TrueBlocks system.
You can query the status; query for information about TrueBlocks caches;
control the creation, sharing, and pinning of the TrueBlocks index of appearances;
and even serve the data through an API.

[See the API documentation for all information about using the API](/api).
