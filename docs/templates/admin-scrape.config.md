| apps&lowbar;per&lowbar;chunk | uint64       | 200000       | the number of appearances to build into a chunk before consolidating it |
| snap&lowbar;to&lowbar;grid | uint64       | 100000       | an override to apps_per_chunk to snap-to-grid at every modulo of this value, this allows easier corrections to the index |
| first&lowbar;snap  | uint64       | 0            | the first block at which snap_to_grid is enabled |
| unripe&lowbar;dist | uint64       | 28           | the distance (in blocks) from the front of the chain under which (inclusive) a block is considered unripe |
| channel&lowbar;count | uint64       | 20           | number of concurrent processing channels |
| allow&lowbar;missing | bool         | true         | do not report errors for blockchains that contain blocks with zero addresses |
