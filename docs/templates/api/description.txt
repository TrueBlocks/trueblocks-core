    A REST layer over the TrueBlocks application. With `chifra daemon`, you can
    run this on your own machine, and make calls to `localhost`.

    ## How to use this API

    This API's endpoints are exact translations of the commands used by the chifra
    CLI application, and the query parameters mirror the commands' options and
    flags. If you want details, [the commands have their own documentation page](/docs/using/introducing-chifra/).

    For detailed descriptions of fields, see [the data model reference](/data-model/intro/).

      ### Before you begin

    1. [Install the trueblocks-core application](/docs/install/install-trueblocks/)
      on your machine, change your configs as needed.
    2. Run `chifra daemon`


      ### Example queries

     By default, all calls are to `localhost:8080`.
     All options and flags are passed through query parameters.

     For example, to get block `100`, make a call to `/blocks` and specify
     the block you want in the query parameter:

     ```shell
     curl "http://localhost:8080/blocks?blocks=100"
     ```

     Some parameters support ranges:

     ```shell
     curl "http://localhost:8080/blocks?blocks=100-120"
     ```

     Other parameters let you filter your responses. For example, to get only
     the unique addresses from that block range:

     ```shell
     curl "http://localhost:8080/blocks?blocks=100-110&uniq=true"
     ```

     You might want to cache queries on your local machine.

     ```shell
     "http://localhost:8080/blocks?blocks=100-110&cache=true"
     ```

     Cacheing speeds up repeat queries significantly. The cache options are
     particularly useful for calls to data-rich endpoints, like most endpoints
     in the  "Accounts" collection.

     Of course, caches occupy local storage. So cache wisely.
