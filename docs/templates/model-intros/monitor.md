A Monitor is a list of [Appearances](/data-model/accounts/#appearance) associated with a given address along with various details about those Appearances. A Monitor is created when a user expresses interest in an address by calling either [chifra list](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-list) or [chifra export](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-export) tool (or querying thier associated APIs).

Once created, a Monitor may be periodically *freshened* by calling either `chifra list` or `chifra export` again, however, it is also possible to keep a Monitor fresh continually by calling [chifra serve --monitor](). This tool watches the front of the chain and repeatedly calls `chifra list`.
