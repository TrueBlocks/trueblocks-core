Left to its own devices, the blockchain would try to convince us that only hashes and bytes are imporant, but being human beings we know that this is not true. TrueBlocks `articulates` various types of data with [chifra names](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-names) detailing the names for addresses, `-articulate` describing the Functions and Events of a transction, and [chifra when](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-when) describing dated blocks. Dated blocks assign a human-readable date to blocks given block numbers or timestamps and visa versa.

The following commands produce and manage [{PLURAL}]:
