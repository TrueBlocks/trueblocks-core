TrueBlocks allows you to associate a human-readable name with an address. This feature goes a long way towards making the blockchain data one extracts with a [Monitor](/data-model/accounts/#monitor) much more readable.

Unlike the blockchain data itself, which is globally available and impossible to censor, the association of names with address is not on chain (excepting ENS, which, while fine, is imcomplete). TrueBlocks allows you to name addresses of interest to you and either share those names (through an on-chain mechanism) or keep them private if you so desire.

Over the years, we've paid careful attention to the 'airwaves' and have collected together a 'starter-set' of named addresses which is available through the [chifra names](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-names) command line. For example, every time people say "Show me your address, and we will airdrop some tokens" on Twitter, we copy and paste all those addresses. We figure if you're going to DOX yourselves, we might as well take advantage of it. Sorry...not sorry.
