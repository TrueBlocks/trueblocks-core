_These fields describe the output of various TrueBlocks blockchain queries.

_Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below_

## Block

`chifra blocks` returns top level data specified block. You can also include
an array for the blocks' transactions.

### How to get blocks

- **CLI**:
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-blocks)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/blocks`](/api#operation/chaindata-blocks)

## Transaction

Transactions represent eth transfers to and from other addresses.

Most of the fields that TrueBlocks returns are standard to all eth transaction.
However, one field is very interesting: `articulatedTx` provides a human readable output of the `input` field.

This is a very powerful way to understand the story behind a smart contract.

### How to get transactions

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra transactions <txn_id>`.
  - Use the `--articulate` option to turn the `input` field human readable.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-transactions)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/transactions`](/api#operation/chaindata-transactions)

## Receipt

Receipts record the amount of gas used for a transaction among other things. If the transaction succeeded, a receipt might also have logs.

If the `to` address of a transaction is `0x0`, the `input` data is considered to be the the source code (byte code) of a smart contract. In this case, if the creation of the contract succeeds, the `contractAddress` field of the receipt carries the address of the newly created contract.

### How to get receipts

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra receipts <txn_id>`.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-receipts)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/receipts`](/api#operation/chaindata-receipts)

### Fields

| Field           | Description                                                                | Type           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| status          | `1` on transaction suceess, `null` if tx preceeds Byzantium, `0` otherwise | uint32         |
| contractAddress | the address of the newly created contract, if any                          | address        |
| gasUsed         | the amount of gas actually used by the transaction                         | gas            |
| logs            | a possibly empty array of logs                                             | CLogEntryArray |

## Log

Logs appear in a possibly empty array in the transaction's receipt. They are only created if the underlying transaction suceeded. In the case where the transaction failed, no logs will appear in the receipt. Logs are only ever generated during transactions whose `to` address is a smart contract.

### How to get logs

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra logs <txn_id>`.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-logs)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/logs`](/api#operation/chaindata-logs)

### Fields

## Trace

The deepest layer of the Ethereum data is the trace. Every transaction has at least one trace which is itself a record of the transaction. If the `to` address of the transaction is a smart contract, other traces may appear, if, for example, that smart contract calls other smart contracts.

Traces may be arbitrarily deep (up to the gasLimit) and ultimately represent a tree of function calls. Some transactions have 100s of traces. The format of the trace is similar to the transaction itself have a trace `action` (which contains `from`, `to`, `value` like the transaction) and the trace `result` (containing `gasUsed` like the receipt).

### How to get traces

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra traces <txn_id>`.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-traces)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/traces`](/api#operation/chaindata-traces)

### Fields

| action           | the trace action for this trace                           | CTraceAction |
| result           | the trace result of this trace                            | CTraceResult |
| articulatedTrace | human readable version of the trace action input data     | CFunction    |
| compressedTrace  | a compressed string version of the articulated trace      | string       |

## TraceAction

Other than the first trace which is the trace of the transaction itself, traces represent calls into smart contracts. Because of this, `trace actions` closely resemble the fields of the [transaction](#transactions).

### Fields

| Field         | Description                                                                | Type    |

| to            | address to which the trace was sent                                        | address |

| callType      | the type of call                                                           | string  |
| refundAddress | if the call type is self-destruct, the address to which the refund is sent | address |

## TraceResult

As mentioned above, other than the first trace, traces represent calls into other smart contracts. Because of this, the trace results closely resembles the fields of the [receipt](#receipts).

### Fields

| Field       | Description                                                                    | Type    |

| code        | if this trace is creating a new smart contract, the byte code of that contract | bytes   |
| gasUsed     | the amount of gas used by this trace                                           | gas     |
| output      | the result of the call of this trace                                           | bytes   |

## DatedBlock

### How to get when blocks

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra when <block_id>`.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-when)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/when`](/api#operation/chaindata-when)

### Fields

| Field       | Description                         | Type      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --------- |

| timestamp   | the unix timestamp of the block     | timestamp |
| date        | Human readable version of timestamp | date      |

## Base types

In these docs, sometimes Trueblocks mentions a type format that is more
precise than the generic types, like "string" or "object".
