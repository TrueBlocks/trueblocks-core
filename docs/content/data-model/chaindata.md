These fields describe the output of various TrueBlocks blockchain queries.

_Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below_

## Block

`chifra blocks` returns top level data specified block. You can also include
an array for the blocks' transactions.

The following commands produce and manage blocks:

| Tools                                                  |                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra blocks](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-blocks) | retrieve one or more blocks from the chain or local cache |

Block data is made of the following data fields:

## Transaction

Transactions represent eth transfers to and from other addresses.

Most of the fields that TrueBlocks returns are standard to all eth transaction.
However, one field is very interesting: `articulatedTx` provides a human readable output of the `input` field.

This is a very powerful way to understand the story behind a smart contract.

The following commands produce and manage transactions:

| Tools                                                              |                                                                 |

## Receipt

Receipts record the amount of gas used for a transaction among other things. If the transaction succeeded, a receipt might also have logs.

If the `to` address of a transaction is `0x0`, the `input` data is considered to be the source code (byte code) of a smart contract. In this case, if the creation of the contract succeeds, the `contractAddress` field of the receipt carries the address of the newly created contract.

The following commands produce and manage receipts:

| Tools                                                      |                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra receipts](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-receipts) | retrieve receipts for the given transaction(s) |

Receipt data is made of the following data fields:

| Field           | Description                                                                | Type           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| status          | `1` on transaction suceess, `null` if tx preceeds Byzantium, `0` otherwise | uint32         |
| contractAddress | the address of the newly created contract, if any                          | address        |
| gasUsed         | the amount of gas actually used by the transaction                         | gas            |
| logs            | a possibly empty array of logs                                             | CLogEntryArray |


## Log

Logs appear in a possibly empty array in the transaction's receipt. They are only created if the underlying transaction suceeded. In the case where the transaction failed, no logs will appear in the receipt. Logs are only ever generated during transactions whose `to` address is a smart contract.

The following commands produce and manage logs:

| Tools                                              |                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [chifra logs](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-logs) | retrieve logs for the given transaction(s) |

Log data is made of the following data fields:

| Field            | Description                                                                                       | Type        |

| timestamp        | the timestamp of the block this log appears in                                                    | timestamp   |
| address          | the smart contract that emitted this log                                                          | address     |

| articulatedLog   | a human-readable version of the topic and data fields                                             | CFunction   |
| compressedLog    | a truncated, more readable version of the articulation                                            | string      |


## Trace

The deepest layer of the Ethereum data is the trace. Every transaction has at least one trace which is itself a record of the transaction. If the `to` address of the transaction is a smart contract, other traces may appear, if, for example, that smart contract calls other smart contracts.

Traces may be arbitrarily deep (up to the gasLimit) and ultimately represent a tree of function calls. Some transactions have 100s of traces. The format of the trace is similar to the transaction itself have a trace `action` (which contains `from`, `to`, `value` like the transaction) and the trace `result` (containing `gasUsed` like the receipt).

The following commands produce and manage traces:

| Tools                                                  |                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra traces](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-traces) | retrieve traces for the given transaction(s) |

Trace data is made of the following data fields:

| Field            | Description                                               | Type         |

| type             | the type of the trace                                     | string       |
| action           | the trace action for this trace                           | CTraceAction |
| result           | the trace result of this trace                            | CTraceResult |
| articulatedTrace | human readable version of the trace action input data     | CFunction    |
| compressedTrace  | a compressed string version of the articulated trace      | string       |


## TraceAction

Other than the first trace which is the trace of the transaction itself, traces represent calls into smart contracts. Because of this, `trace actions` closely resemble the fields of the [transaction](#transactions).

The following commands produce and manage traceactions:

| Tools                                                  |                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra traces](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-traces) | retrieve traces for the given transaction(s) |

Traceaction data is made of the following data fields:

| Field         | Description                                                                | Type    |

| gas           | the maximum number of gas allowed for this trace                           | gas     |
| input         | an encoded version of the function call                                    | bytes   |
| callType      | the type of call                                                           | string  |
| refundAddress | if the call type is self-destruct, the address to which the refund is sent | address |


## TraceResult

As mentioned above, other than the first trace, traces represent calls into other smart contracts. Because of this, the trace results closely resembles the fields of the [receipt](#receipts).

The following commands produce and manage traceresults:

| Tools                                                  |                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra traces](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-traces) | retrieve traces for the given transaction(s) |

Traceresult data is made of the following data fields:

| Field       | Description                                                                    | Type    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| newContract | Address of new contract, if any                                                | address |
| code        | if this trace is creating a new smart contract, the byte code of that contract | bytes   |
| gasUsed     | the amount of gas used by this trace                                           | gas     |
| output      | the result of the call of this trace                                           | bytes   |


## DatedBlock

Left to its own devices, the blockchain would try to convince us that only hashes and bytes are important, but being human beings we know that this is not true. TrueBlocks `articulates` various types of data with [chifra names](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-names) detailing the names for addresses, `-articulate` describing the Functions and Events of a transaction, and [chifra when](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-when) describing dated blocks. Dated blocks assign a human-readable date to blocks given block numbers or timestamps and visa versa.

The following commands produce and manage datedblocks:

| Tools                                              |                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra when](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-when) | find block(s) based on date, blockNum, timestamp, or 'special' |

Datedblock data is made of the following data fields:

| Field       | Description                         | Type      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| blockNumber | the number of the block             | blknum    |
| timestamp   | the Unix timestamp of the block     | timestamp |
| date        | Human readable version of timestamp | date      |


## Base types

This documentation mentions the following basic data types.

| Type      | Description                                     | Notes          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
