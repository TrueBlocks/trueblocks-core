The primary purpose of TrueBlocks is to extract, directly from the blockchain, the entire transactional history for one or more addresses and present that information for use outside the blockchain. The results of this extraction are stored in a data structure called a [Monitor](/data-model/accounts/#monitor).

Monitors collect together [Appearances](/data-model/accounts/#appearance) (`blknum.tx_id` pairs) along with additional information such as [Reconciliations](/data-model/accounts/#reconciliation) (18-decimal place accurate accounting for each asset transfer), [Names](/data-model/accounts/#names) (associations of human-readable names with addresses), and [Abis](/data-model/accounts/#abis) which track the "meaning" of each transaction through its [Functions](/data-model/accounts/#function) and [Parameters](/data-model/accounts/#parameters).

_Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below_

## Monitor

A Monitor is a list of [Appearances](/data-model/accounts/#appearance) associated with a given address along with various details about those appearances. A monitor is created when a user expresses interest in an address by calling either [chifra list](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-list) or [chifra export](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-export) tool (or querying thier associated APIs).

Once created, a monitor may be periodically *freshened* by calling either `chifra list` or `chifra export`, however, it is also possible to freshen a monitor continually with [chifra scrape --monitors](/docs/chifra/admin/#chifra-scrape). This tool watches the front of the chain and repeatedly calls `chifra list`.

The following commands produce and manage monitors:

| Tools                                                       |                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [chifra status monitors](/docs/chifra/admin/#chifra-status) | report on the status of the TrueBlocks system                |
| [chifra list](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-list)           | list appearances for one or more addresses                   |
| [chifra export](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-export)       | export full detail of transactions for one or more addresses |
| [chifra monitors](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-monitors)   | delete, undelete, and remove previously created monitors     |

Monitor data is made of the following data fields:

| Field       | Description                                    | Type    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| nApps       | the number of appearances for this monitor     | blknum  |
| firstApp    | the first block at which this address appears  | blknum  |
| latestApp   | the latest block at which this address appears | blknum  |
| sizeInBytes | the size of this monitor on disc               | uint64  |
| tags        | the tag given to this address                  | string  |
| address     | the address being monitored                    | address |
| is_custom   | `true` if this address is customized           | bool    |


## Appearance

An appearance is a pointer (`blknum, tx_id` pair) into the blockchain indicating where a particular address appears. This includes obvious locations such as `to` or `from` as well as esoteric locations such as deep inside a tenth-level trace or as the miner of an uncle block. The primary goal of TrueBlocks is to identify every appearance for any address on the chain.

The TrueBlocks [index of appearances](/data-model/the-index/) (created by [chifra scrape](/docs/chifra/admin/#chifra-scrape)) makes the production of such a list possible. Appearances are stored in [Monitors](http://localhost:1313/data-model/accounts/#monitor).

The following commands produce and manage appearances:

| Tools                                                 |                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [chifra list](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-list)     | list appearances for one or more addresses                   |
| [chifra export](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-export) | export full detail of transactions for one or more addresses |

Appearance data is made of the following data fields:

| Field            | Description                                               | Type      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| blockNumber      | the number of the block                                   | blknum    |
| transactionIndex | the zero-indexed position of the transaction in the block | blknum    |
| address          | the address of the appearance                             | address   |
| name             | the name of the address, if found                         | string    |
| timestamp        | the timestamp for this appearance                         | timestamp |
| date             | the date represented by the timestamp                     | string    |


## Reconciliation

When exported with the `--accounting` option from `chifra export`, each transaction will have field called `statements`. Statements are an array for reconciliations. All such exported transactions will have at least one reconciliation (for ETH), however, many will have additional reconciliations for other assets (such as ERC20 and ERC721 tokens).

Because DeFi is essentially swaps and trades around ERC20s, and because and 'programmable money' allows for unlimited actions to happen under a single transaction, many times a transaction has four or five reconciliations.

Reconciliations are relative to an `accountedFor` address. For this reason, the same transaction will probably have different reconciliations depending on the `accountedFor` address. Consider a simple transfer of ETH from one address to another. Obviously, the sender's and the recipient's reconciliations will differ (in opposite proportion to each other). The `accountedFor` address is always present as the `assetAddress` in the first reconciliation of the statements array.

The following commands produce and manage reconciliations:

**Notes**

**Intra-block transactions**: In many cases two or more transactions requiring a reconciliation may occur in a single block. Because the Ethereum blockchain only provides balance queries at the end of blocks, it is not possible to query for the balance of an asset at the end of transactions for which there are other following transactions in the block nor for the beginning balance for which there are transactions prior to the given transaction in the same block. In these cases, TrueBlocks simulates the beginning and ending balance as needed and adds `partial` to the `reconciliationType`.

**Spot Price**: If the `spotPrice` is available from an on-chain source (such as UniSwap), then it represents the ETH/DAI value at the time of the transaction if the reconciliation is for ETH. For other assets, the `spotPrice` represents the asset's value relative to `ETH`, so to price a non-ETH asset in US dollars, one would need to convert first to `ETH` then to dollars. If a price is not available on-chain, the `spotPrice` will be zero and the caller is encouraged to get the price for the asset from other sources.


## Name

TrueBlocks allows you to associate a human-readable name with an address. This feature goes a long way towards making the blockchain data one extracts with a [Monitor](/data-model/accounts/#monitor) much more readable.

Unlike the blockchain data itself, which is globally available and impossible to censor, the association of names with address is not on chain (excepting ENS, which, while fine, is incomplete). TrueBlocks allows you to name addresses of interest to you and either share those names (through an on-chain mechanism) or keep them private if you so desire.

Over the years, we've paid careful attention to the 'airwaves' and have collected together a 'starter-set' of named addresses which is available through the [chifra names](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-names) command line. For example, every time people say "Show me your address, and we will airdrop some tokens" on Twitter, we copy and paste all those addresses. We figure if you're going to DOX yourselves, we might as well take advantage of it. Sorry...not sorry.

The following commands produce and manage names:

| Tools                                               |                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra names](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-names) | query addresses or names of well known accounts |

Name data is made of the following data fields:

| Field       | Description                                                                         | Type    |

| is_custom   | `true` if the address is a custom address, `false` otherwise                        | bool    |
| is_prefund  | `true` if the address was one of the prefund addresses, `false` otherwise           | bool    |
| is_contract | `true` if the address is a smart contract, `false` otherwise                        | bool    |
| is_erc20    | `true` if the address is an ERC20, `false` otherwise                                | bool    |
| is_erc721   | `true` if the address is an ERC720, `false` otherwise                               | bool    |


## Abi

An ABI describes an Application Binary Interface -- in other words, the [Function](/data-model/other/#function) and Event signatures for a given smart contract. Along with [Names](/data-model/accounts/#names) the use of ABIs goes a very long way towards making your Ethereum data much more understandable.

Similar to names of addresses, ABI files are not available on-chain which means they must be acquired somewhere. Unfortunately, the Ethereum community has not yet understand that EtherScan is not a good place to store this very important information. For this reason, TrueBlocks uses EtherScan to acquire ABI files and therefor one needs to get an EtherScan API key to use this function.

The following commands produce and manage abis:

| Tools                                             |                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [chifra abis](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-abis) | fetches the ABI for a smart contract |

Abi data is made of the following data fields:

| Field      | Description                                  | Type           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| address    | the smart contract that implements this abi  | address        |
| interfaces | the list of events and functions on this abi | CFunctionArray |

**Notes**

See the `chifra abis` command line for information about getting an EtherScan key.
