The primary purpose of TrueBlocks is to extract, directly from the blockchain, the entire transactional history for one or more addresses and present that information for use outside the blockchain. The results of this extraction are stored in a data structure called a [Monitor](/data-model/accounts/#monitor).

Monitors collect together [Appearances](/data-model/accounts/#appearance) (`blknum.tx_id` pairs) along with additional information such as [Reconciliations](/data-model/accounts/#reconciliation) (18-decimal place accurate accounting for each asset transfer), [Names](/data-model/accounts/#names) (associations of human-readable names with addresses), and [Abis](/data-model/accounts/#abis) which track the "meaning" of each transaction through its [Functions](/data-model/accounts/#function) and [Parameters](/data-model/accounts/#parameters).

_Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below_

## Monitor

A Monitor is a list of [Appearances](/data-model/accounts/#appearance) associated with a given address along with various details about those Appearances. A Monitor is created when a user expresses interest in an address by calling either [chifra list](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-list) or [chifra export](/docs/chifra/accounts/#chifra-export) tool (or querying thier associated APIs).

Once created, a Monitor may be periodically *freshened* by calling either `chifra list` or `chifra export` again, however, it is also possible to keep a Monitor fresh continually by calling [chifra serve --monitor](). This tool watches the front of the chain and repeatedly calls `chifra list`.

## Reconciliation

When exported with the `--accounting` option from `chifra export`, each transaction will have field called `statements`. Statements are an array for reconciliations. All such exported transactions will have at least one reconcilation (for ETH), however, many will have additional reconciliations for other assets (such as ERC20 and ERC721 tokens).

Because DeFi is essentially swaps and trades around ERC20s, and because and 'programmable money' allows for unlimited actions to happen under a single transaction,many times a transaction has four or five reconciliations.

Reconciliations are relative to an `accountedFor` address. For this reason, the same transaction will probably have different reconciliations depending on the `accountedFor` address. Consider a simple transfer of ETH from one address to another. Obviously, the sender's and the recipient's reconciliations will differ (in opposite proportion to each other). The `accountedFor` address is always present as the `assetAddress` in the first reconciliation of the statements array.

**Note on intra-block transactions**: In many cases two or more transactions requiring a reconciliation may occur in a single block. Becuase the Ethereum blockchain only provides balance queries at the end of blocks, it is not possible to query for the balance of an asset at the end of transactions for which there are other following transactions in the block nor for the beginning balance for which there are transactions prior to the given transaction in the same block. In these cases, TrueBlocks simulates the beginning and ending balance as needed and adds `partial` to the `reconciliationType`.

**Note on spotPrice**: If the `spotPrice` is available from an on-chain source (such as UniSwap), then it represents the ETH/DAI value at the time of the transaction if the reconcilation is for ETH. For other assets, the `spotPrice` represents the asset's value relative to `ETH`, so to price a non-ETH asset in US dollars, one would need to convert first to `ETH` then to dollars. If a price is not available on-chain, the `spotPrice` will be zero and the caller is encouraged to get the price for the asset from other sources.

## Name

_Accounts_ link an address to a name.

Accounts are a combination of an`address`, a `name`, and optionally other data. Where possible, this information is queried directly from the blockchain, however in many cases the information was gathered from various websites over the years. For example, every time people say "Show me your address, and we will airdrop some tokens" on Twitter, we copy and paste all those addresses. If you're going to DOX yourselves, we're going to notice. Sorry. Not sorry.

precise than the generic types, like "string" or "object".
