_These fields describe the output of various TrueBlocks blockchain queries.
For information about how to refine these queries, see
[the corresponding CLI section](/docs/chifra/chaindata/)_

## Transactions

Transactions represent eth transfers to and from other addresses.

Most of the fields that TrueBlocks returns are standard to all eth transaction.
However, one field is very interesting: `articulatedTx` provides a human readable output of the `input` field.

This is a very powerful way to understand the story behind a smart contract.

### How to get transactions

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra transactions <txn_id>`.
  - Use the `--articulate` option to turn the `input` field human readable.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-transactions)

| finalized       | a flag indicating if TrueBlocks considers this block final                    | boolean      |

## Receipts

Receipts record the amount of gas used for a transaction among other things. If the transaction succeeded, a receipt might also have logs.

If the `to` address of a transaction is `0x0`, the `input` data is considered to be the the source code (byte code) of a smart contract. In this case, if the creation of the contract succeeds, the `contractAddress` field of the receipt carries the address of the newly created contract.

### How to get receipts

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra receipts <txn_id>`.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-receipts)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/receipts`](/api#operation/chaindata-receipts)
- **Explorer**

### Reference of receipt fields

| Field           | Description                                       | Type         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| status          | `1` if the transaction suceeds, `0` otherwise     | number       |
| contractAddress | the address of the newly created contract, if any | address      |

| logs            | a possibly empty array of [logs](#logs)           | object array |

## Logs

Logs appear in a possibly empty array in the transaction's receipt. They are only created if the underlying transaction suceeded. In the case where the transaction failed, no logs will appear in the receipt. Logs are only ever generated during transactions whose `to` address is a smart contract.

### How to get logs

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra logs <txn_id>`.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-logs)

## Traces

The deepest layer of the Ethereum data is the trace. Every transaction has at least one trace which is itself a record of the transaction. If the `to` address of the transaction is a smart contract, other traces may appear, if, for example, that smart contract calls other smart contracts.

Traces may be arbitrarily deep (up to the gasLimit) and ultimately represent a tree of function calls. Some transactions have 100s of traces. The format of the trace is similar to the transaction itself have a trace `action` (which contains `from`, `to`, `value` like the transaction) and the trace `result` (containing `gasUsed` like the receipt).

### How to get traces

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra traces <txn_id>`.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-traces)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/traces`](/api#operation/chaindata-traces)
- **Explorer**

### Reference of trace fields

| Field            | description                                             | type   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| blockHash        | the hash of the block in which this transaction appears | hash   |
| blockNumber      | the block number of the containing block                | blknum |
| transactionHash  | the transaction's hash                                  | hash   |
| transactionIndex | the transaction's zero-indexed position in the block    | blknum |
| traceAddress     | a particular trace's address in the trace tree          | string |
| subTraces        | the number of children traces that the trace has        | number |
| type             | the type of the trace                                   | string |

| result           | the [trace result](#trace-result)                       | object |

#### Trace action

Other than the first trace which is the trace of the transaction itself, traces represent calls into smart contracts. Because of this, `trace actions` closely resemble the fields of the [transaction](#transactions).

| Field            | Description                                                                        | Type    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| from             | the smart contract address that called the trace                                   | address |
| to               | the smart contract address that the trace calls                                    | address |
| gas              | The maximum amount of gas allowed for this call                                    | wei     |
| input            | an encoded version of the function call. Use the `--articulate` to display details | bytes   |
| callType         | the type of this call                                                              | string  |
| refundAddress    | if the call type is `self-destruct`, the address to which the refund is sent       | address |
|                  |                                                                                    |         |
| articulatedTrace | A human-readable version of the trace action's `input` and the result's `output`   | object  |
| compressedTrace  | a truncated, more readable version of the articulation                             | string  |

#### Trace result

As mentioned above, other than the first trace, traces represent calls into other smart contracts. Because of this, the trace results closely resembles the fields of the [receipt](#receipts).

| Field       | description                                                                            | type   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| newContract | address of the newly created contract, if any                                          | string |
| code        | if this trace is creating a new smart contract, this is the byte code of that contract | bytes  |
| gasUsed     | the amount of gas used during the call                                                 | wei    |
| output      | the result of the call for this trace                                                  | bytes  |

## when block

### How to get when blocks

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra when <block_id>`.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-when)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/when`](/api#operation/chaindata-when)
- **Explorer**

### Reference of whenblock fields

When a block appeared, in unix and human readable format:

| Field       | Description                              | Type      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| blockNumber | the block number of the containing block | blknum    |
| timestamp   | the block's unix timestamp               | timestamp |
| date        | human readable version of the timestamp  | date      |

## Reconciliations

When exported with the `--accounting` option from `chifra export`, each transaction will have field called `statements`. Statements are an array for reconciliations. All such exported transactions will have at least one reconcilation (for ETH), however, many will have additional reconciliations for other assets (such as ERC20 and ERC721 tokens).

Because DeFi is essentially swaps and trades around ERC20s, and because and 'programmable money' allows for unlimited actions to happen under a single transaction,many times a transaction has four or five reconciliations.

Reconciliations are relative to an `accountedFor` address. For this reason, the same transaction will probably have different reconciliations depending on the `accountedFor` address. Consider a simple transfer of ETH from one address to another. Obviously, the sender's and the recipient's reconciliations will differ (in opposite proportion to each other). The `accountedFor` address is always present as the `assetAddress` in the first reconciliation of the statements array.

**Note on intra-block transactions**: In many cases two or more transactions requiring a reconciliation may occur in a single block. Becuase the Ethereum blockchain only provides balance queries at the end of blocks, it is not possible to query for the balance of an asset at the end of transactions for which there are other following transactions in the block nor for the beginning balance for which there are transactions prior to the given transaction in the same block. In these cases, TrueBlocks simulates the beginning and ending balance as needed and adds `partial` to the `reconciliationType`.

**Note on spotPrice**: If the `spotPrice` is available from an on-chain source (such as UniSwap), then it represents the ETH/DAI value at the time of the transaction if the reconcilation is for ETH. For other assets, the `spotPrice` represents the asset's value relative to `ETH`, so to price a non-ETH asset in US dollars, one would need to convert first to `ETH` then to dollars. If a price is not available on-chain, the `spotPrice` will be zero and the caller is encouraged to get the price for the asset from other sources.

## Reference of type formats

In these docs, sometimes Trueblocks mentions a type format that is more
precise than the generic types, like "string" or "object".

| Type Name | Description                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| blknum    | a 64-bit unsigned int               |
| timestamp | a 64-bit unsigned int               |
| address   | a 20 byte string starting with '0x' |
| hash      | a 32 byte string starting with '0x' |
| string    | a plain c++ string                  |
| number    | standard c++ 64-bit unsigned int    |
| bigint    | arbitrarily sized signed int        |
| wei       | arbitrarily sized unsigned int      |
| boolean   | standard c++ boolean                |
