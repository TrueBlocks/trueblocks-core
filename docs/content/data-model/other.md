These commands call some useful miscellaneous tools:
* `chifra quotes`, a rudimentary pricing tool,
* `chifra explore` a quick way to open a blockchain explorer,
* `ethslurp` an older tool that lets you call data from EtherScan. (This has issues of ceentralization and data quality, see explanation in its section).

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" title="note about keys"
text="Note: some of these tools, like `ethslurp`, require an EtherScan key." >}}
[Follow these instructions to add a key to your config](https://docs.trueblocks.io/docs/prologue/installing-trueblocks/#3-update-the-configs-for-your-rpc-and-api-keys)

_Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below_

## Quote

<!-- TEXT ABOUT PRICE QUOTES -->

### How to get price quotes

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra transactions <txn_id>`.
  - Use the `--articulate` option to turn the `input` field human readable.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-transactions)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/transactions`](/api#operation/chaindata-transactions)

Below is a list of the data fields for quotes. Following that are the commands that produce or manage quotes.
