<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD036 MD041 -->
The data models produced by the tools in the Admin category relate to scraping the chain, producing
the Unchained Index, and querying the configuration of the system. Additional data related to
sharing the indexes via IPFS and pinning the same are also produced by tools in this category.

Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below.

## Status

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD036 MD041 -->
The [chifra config](/chifra/admin/#chifra-config) tool reports on the state (and size) of the
various TrueBlocks local binary caches. TrueBlocks produces nine difference caches: `abis`, `blocks`,
`monitors`, `names`, `objs`, `recons`, `slurps`, `traces`, `transactions`. In general practice, these caches
may take up a few GB of hard drive space, however, for very popular smart contract the size of the
caches may grow rather large. Keep an eye on it.

The `status` data model is a complex beast. It contains various information including a list of
registered chains, information about many of the internal binary caches maintained by `chifra`
as well as current status information about the system including version information for both
`chifra` and the node it's running against.

The following commands produce and manage Statuses:

- [chifra status](/chifra/admin/#chifra-status)

Statuses consist of the following fields:

## Manifest

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD036 MD041 -->
The Manifest details the portions of the index of appearances which are called ChunkRecords. Each record in the
Manifest details the block range represented by the chunk as well as the IPFS hash of the index chunk along with
the associated IPFS hash for the Bloom filter of the chunk. The manifest itself is also pushed to IPFS and the
IPFS of the hash of the manifest is published periodically to the Unchained Index smart contract.

The following commands produce and manage Manifests:

- [chifra chunks](/chifra/admin/#chifra-chunks)
- [chifra init](/chifra/admin/#chifra-init)
- [chifra scrape](/chifra/admin/#chifra-scrape)

Manifests consist of the following fields:

| Field     | Description                                                           | Type                                            |

## ChunkRecord

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD036 MD041 -->
The TrueBlocks index scraper periodically creates a chunked portion of the index so that it can
be more easily stored in a content-addresable data store such as IPFS. We call these
periodically-created chunks ChunkRecords. The format of said item is described here. A pinned
chunk is effectively a relational table relating all of the addresses appearing in the chunk
with a list of appearances appearing in the chunk.

The following commands produce and manage ChunkRecords:

- [chifra chunks](/chifra/admin/#chifra-chunks)

portions. The information here is mostly for internal use only as it includes the size and number
of the bloom filters present as well as the number of addresses inserted into the bloom. This
information is used to study the characteristics of the Unchained Index.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD036 MD041 -->
The `addresses` data model is produced by `chifra chunks` and represents the records found in the
addresses table of each Unchained Index chunk. The `offset` and `count` fields represent the
