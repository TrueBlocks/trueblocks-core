The Admin component allows you to query the status of the TrueBlocks system. You may query the status; query for information about TrueBlocks caches; control the creation, sharing, and pinning of the TrueBlocks index of appearances; and even serve the data through an API.

_Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below_

## Status

<!-- TEXT ABOUT STATUS -->

### How to get status

- **CLI**:
  - Run `chifra status <options>`
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-transactions)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/transactions`](/api#operation/chaindata-transactions)

Below is a list of the data fields for status. Following that are the commands that produce or manage status.  
### Fields
