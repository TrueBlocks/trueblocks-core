The data models produced by the tools in the Admin category relate to scraping the chain, producing the Unchained Index, and querying the configuration of the system. Additional data related to sharing the indexes via IPFS and pinning the same are also produced by tools in this category.

Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below.

## Status

The [chifra config](/docs/chifra/admin/#chifra-config) tool reports on the state (and size) of the various TrueBlocks local binary caches. TrueBlocks produces nine difference caches: `abis`, `blocks`, `monitors`, `names`, `objs`, `recons`, `slurps`, `traces`, `txs`. In general practice, these caches may take up a few GB of hard drive space, however, for very popular smart contract the size of the caches may grow rather large. Keep an eye on it.

The following commands produce and manage status:

| Tools                                              |                                               |

## Cache

The [chifra config <type>](/docs/chifra/admin/#chifra-config) reports on the binary caches. Those reports come in the form of the Cache data type. Each cache data object may carry unique information for the given cache. See the source code for more information.

The following commands produce and manage caches:

| Tools                                              |                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra config](/docs/chifra/admin/#chifra-config) | report on the status of the TrueBlocks system |

Cache data is made of the following data fields:

| Field       | Description                                             | Type             |

| items       | an array of cache items                                 | CCacheEntryArray |

## PinnedChunk

The TrueBlocks index scraper periodically creates a chunked portion of the index so that it can be more easily stored in a content-addresable data store such as IPFS. We call these periodically-created chunks, PinnedChunks. The format of said item is described here. A pinned chunk is effectively a relational table relating all of the addresses appearing in the chunk with a list of appearances appearing in the chunk.

The following commands produce and manage pinnedchunks:

| Tools                                              |                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [chifra scrape](/docs/chifra/admin/#chifra-scrape) | scan the chain and update the TrueBlocks index of appearances   |
| [chifra chunks](/docs/chifra/admin/#chifra-chunks) | manage pinned index of appearances and associated Bloom filters |

Pinnedchunk data is made of the following data fields:

| Field     | Description                                                 | Type     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| range     | for each chunk, the range of blocks contained in that chunk | string   |
| bloomHash | the IPFS hash of the bloom filter at that range             | ipfshash |
| indexHash | the IPFS hash of the index chunk at that range              | ipfshash |
| firstApp  | the first appearance in the chunk                           | blknum   |
| latestApp | the latest appearance in the chunk                          | blknum   |

## Manifest

The Manifest details the index of appearance's PinnedChunks. Each record in the Manifest details the block range represented by the chunk as well as the IPFS hash of the index chunk along with the associated IPFS hash for the Bloom filter of the chunk. The manifest itself is also pushed to IPFS and the IPFS of the hash of the manifest is published periodically to the Unchained Index smart contract.

The following commands produce and manage manifests:

| Tools                                              |                                                                 |

This information is used to study the characteristics of the Unchained Index.

## ChunkAddresses

The `addresses` data model is produced by `chifra chunks` and represents the records found in the addresses table of each Unchained Index chunk. The `offset` and `count` fields represent the location and number of records in the `appearances` table to which the address table is related.

The following commands produce and manage chunkAddresses:
