These commands compare the balance of an address against a particular token or block.

_Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below_

## State

The following commands produce and manage states:

| Tools |     |
| ----- | --- |

The balance of an address at a given block.

* CLI: [chifra state](/docs/chifra/chainstate/#chifra-state)
* [API](/api#operation/chainstate-state)

State data is made of the following data fields:
