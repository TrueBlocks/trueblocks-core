The data structures produced by tools in the Chain State category provide details on the balances
(ERC20 or ETH) of an address against a particular token or block. Additionally, direct access to
a smart contract's state may be queries with the `chirfa state` tool. Data structures in that case
are specific to the particular smart contract.

Each data structure is created by one or more tools which are detailed below.

## State

For the `chifra state --call` tool, the `result` is the result returned by the call to the smart
contract. This is the decoded `output` value of the smart contract call.

The following commands produce and manage States:

- [chifra state](/chifra/chainstate/#chifra-state)

States consist of the following fields:

| Field       | Description                                                                   | Type      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| blockNumber | the block number at which this call was made                                  | blknum    |
| timestamp   | the timestamp of the block for this call                                      | timestamp |
| date        | the timestamp as a date (calculated)                                          | datetime  |

| balance     | the balance of the account at the given block                                 | wei       |
| ether       | if --ether is specified, the balance in ether (calculated)                    | ether     |
| code        | the code of the account                                                       | string    |
| deployed    | for smart contracts only, the block number at which the contract was deployed | blknum    |
| nonce       | the nonce of the account at the given block                                   | value     |
| proxy       | the proxy address of the account at the given block                           | address   |

## Token

The `token` data model represents the name, decmials, token symbol, and optionally the totalSupply
of an ERC-20 token.

The following commands produce and manage Tokens:

- [chifra tokens](/chifra/chainstate/#chifra-tokens)
- [chifra export](/chifra/accounts/#chifra-export)

Tokens consist of the following fields:

| Field            | Description                                                                  | Type      |
