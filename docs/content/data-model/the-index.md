## Benefits of unchaining the index

We've written a lot about the Unchained Index elsewhere. We won't belabour the point, however, we want
to point out that the Unchained Index:

- Allows blazingly fast access to any account anywhere on the chain
- Allows perfectly-private access to query blockchain data completely locally
- Naturally shards itself and distributes itself using IPFS and user behaviour
- Is published periodically to a smart contract and once published cannot be removed from public use
- Is reproducable directly from immutable data with a well-defined series of operations meaning its as immutable as the original blockchain data
- Compact
- Digs deeper into the blockchain than any other source allowing for instantaneous, 18-decimal-place accurate off-chain reconciliation of any account
- Blazingly fast

Here we present a number of articles we've written about TrueBlocks over the years. Read at least a few of these and you will better understand what we're trying to do.
