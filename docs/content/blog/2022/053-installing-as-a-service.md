One of our users ([Magnus Hansson](https://magnushansson.xyz/)) has written an excellent article on how to install all three of [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon), Erigon's RPC, and [TrueBlocks](http://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core) as serives on Ubuntu.

Not only that -- the blog post is visually wonderful as well.

Thanks Magnus. Looking for some amazing data science from this quarter. Cheers.
