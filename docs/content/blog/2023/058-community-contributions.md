From one of our community members. Thanks Leo!

For the fellow newbies, I took notes when starting this journey. I wrote a couple of posts I hope are helpful if you are setting up your own node with TrueBlocks.

Please note I focus on doing analytics. Storing and accessing the data are the most important factors for me. Thanks to everybody for the patience and helping me with all the issues!!
