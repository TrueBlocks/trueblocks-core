These commands call some useful miscellaneous tools:
* `chifra quotes`, a rudimentary pricing tool,
* `chifra explore` a quick way to open a blockchain explorer,
* `ethslurp` an older tool that lets you call data from EtherScan. (This has issues of centralization and data quality, see explanation in its section).

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" title="note about keys"
text="Note: some of these tools, like `ethslurp`, require an EtherScan key." >}}

## chifra quotes

The `chifra quotes` tool provides USD ($) price data to other tools and to the command line. Currently, `chifra quotes` retrieves its price data from the Poloniex API. In future versions, we will add other sources and provide a mechanism for fair averaging. Ultimately, as more of this type of price data becomes available on chain, we will use those source, but this is not yet implemented.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Freshen or display Ethereum price data. This tool has been deprecated.

Usage:
  chifra quotes [flags]

Flags:
  -f, --freshen         Freshen price database
  -p, --period string   increment of display

  -a, --pair string     which price pair to freshen or list (see Poloniex)
  -e, --feed string     the feed for the price data
                        One of poloniex, maker, tellor

Global Flags:

  -h, --help         display this help screen
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)

Notes:
  - Due to restrictions from Poloniex, this tool retrieves only 30 days of data at a time. You must repeatedly run this command until the data is up-to-date.

## chifra explore

`chifra explore` opens Etherscan (and other explorers -- including our own) to the block, transaction hash, or address you specify. It's a handy (configurable) way to open an explorer from the command line, nothing more.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Open an explorer for one or more addresses, blocks, or transactions.

Usage:
  chifra explore [flags] <term> [term...]

Arguments:
  terms - one or more addresses, names, block, or transaction identifiers

Flags:
  -l, --local    open the local TrueBlocks explorer
  -g, --google   search google excluding popular blockchain explorers

Global Flags:
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -h, --help         display this help screen
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
```
