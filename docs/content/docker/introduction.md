Everything that's available from the TrueBlocks command line tool, chifra, is also available in a docker version.

TrueBlocks Docker provides an easy way for users to access and interact with an Ethereum node. It includes a comprehensive suite of [tools and commands](/chifra/introduction) that allow users to easily query and analyze data directly from the chain.

With TrueBlocks Docker, users can quickly explore and visualize chain data, create custom scripts using our SDKs and perform sophisticated data analysis.

Additionally, EDS provides access to various web-based data sources, such as Etherscan and Infura, so users can quickly access and analyze blockchain data. The Docker version of EDS also provides quick access to the Ethereum network, allowing users to connect to testnets and mainnets as needed. This makes it possible for users to interact with the Ethereum network and develop applications on the mainnet. Furthermore, the Docker version of EDS is designed to be easily deployed and used without any installation or setup.

## Installation Instructions
