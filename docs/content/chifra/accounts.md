<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD036 MD041 -->
The Accounts group of commands is at the heart of TrueBlocks. They allow you to produce and analyze
transactional histories for one or more Ethereum addresses.

You may also name addresses; grab the ABI file for a given address; add, delete, and remove
monitors, and, most importantly, export transactional histories in various formats, This
includes re-directing output to remote or local databases.

To the right is a list of commands in this group. Click on a command to see its full documentation.
## chifra list

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
`chifra list` takes one or more addresses, queries the index of appearances, and builds TrueBlocks
monitors. A TrueBlocks monitor is a file that contains blockNumber.transactionId pairs (transaction
identifiers) representing the history of the address.

Because TrueBlocks only extracts data from the Ethereum node when it's requested, the first time
you list an address it takes about a minute. Subsequent queries are much faster because TrueBlocks
caches the results.

Note that `chifra list` only queries the index, it does not extract the full transactional details.
You may use `chifra export` for that.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  List every appearance of an address anywhere on the chain.

Usage:
  chifra list [flags] <address> [address...]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses (0x...) to list (required)

Flags:
  -U, --count               display only the count of records for each monitor
  -n, --no_zero             suppress the display of zero appearance accounts
  -c, --first_record uint   the first record to process (default 1)
  -e, --max_records uint    the maximum number of records to process (default 250)
  -F, --first_block uint    first block to export (inclusive, ignored when freshening)
  -L, --last_block uint     last block to export (inclusive, ignored when freshening)
  -x, --fmt string          export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose             enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help                display this help screen

Notes:
  - No other options are permitted when --silent is selected.

## chifra export

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
The `chifra export` tools provides a major part of the functionality of the TrueBlocks system. Using
the index of appearances created with `chifra scrape` and the list of transaction identifiers
created with `chifra list`, `chifra export` completes the actual extraction of an address's transactional
history from the node.

You may use `topics`, `fourbyte` values at the start of a transaction's input data, and/or a log's
`source address` or `emitter` to filter the results.

You may also choose which portions of the Ethereum data structures (`--transactions`, `--logs`,
`--traces`, etc.) as you wish.

By default, the results of the extraction are delivered to your console, however, you may export
the results to any database (with a little bit of work). The format of the data, its content and
its destination are up to you.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Export full detail of transactions for one or more addresses.

Usage:
  chifra export [flags] <address> [address...] [topics...] [fourbytes...]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses (0x...) to export (required)
  topics - filter by one or more log topics (only for --logs option)
  fourbytes - filter by one or more fourbytes (only for transactions and trace options)

Flags:
  -p, --appearances         export a list of appearances
  -r, --receipts            export receipts instead of transactional data
  -l, --logs                export logs instead of transactional data
  -t, --traces              export traces instead of transactional data
  -n, --neighbors           export the neighbors of the given address
  -C, --accounting          attach accounting records to the exported data (applies to transactions export only)
  -A, --statements          for the accounting options only, export only statements
  -a, --articulate          articulate transactions, traces, logs, and outputs
  -i, --cache               write transactions to the cache (see notes)
  -R, --cache_traces        write traces to the cache (see notes)
  -U, --count               only available for --appearances mode, if present, return only the number of records
  -c, --first_record uint   the first record to process (default 1)
  -e, --max_records uint    the maximum number of records to process (default 250)
      --relevant            for log and accounting export only, export only logs relevant to one of the given export addresses
      --emitter strings     for log export only, export only logs if emitted by one of these address(es)
      --topic strings       for log export only, export only logs with this topic(s)
      --asset strings       for the accounting options only, export statements only for this asset
  -f, --flow string         for the accounting options only, export statements with incoming, outgoing, or zero value
                            One of [ in | out | zero ]
  -y, --factory             for --traces only, report addresses created by (or self-destructed by) the given address(es)
  -u, --unripe              export transactions labeled upripe (i.e. less than 28 blocks old)
  -F, --first_block uint    first block to process (inclusive)
  -L, --last_block uint     last block to process (inclusive)
  -x, --fmt string          export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose             enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help                display this help screen

Notes:
  - An address must start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - Articulating the export means turn the EVM's byte data into human-readable text (if possible).
  - For the --logs option, you may optionally specify one or more --emitter, one or more --topics, or both.
  - The --logs option is significantly faster if you provide an --emitter or a --topic.
  - Neighbors include every address that appears in any transaction in which the export address also appears.
  - If provided, --max_records dominates, also, if provided, --first_record overrides --first_block.

## chifra monitors

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
`chifra monitors`` has two purposes: (1) to `--watch` a set of addresses. This function is in its early
stages and will be better explained elsewhere. Please see an example of what one may do with
`chifra monitors --watch` [here](https://tokenomics.io/), and (2) allows one to manage existing
monitored addresses.

A "monitor" is simply a file on a hard drive that represents the transactional history of a given
Ethereum address. Monitors are very small, being only the `<block_no><tx_id>` pair representing each
appearance of an address. Monitor files are only created when a user expresses interest in a
particular address. In this way, TrueBlock is able to continue to work on small desktop or even
laptop computers. (See `chifra list`.)

You may use the `--delete` command to delete (or `--undelete` if already deleted) an address. The
monitor is not removed from your computer if you delete it. It is just marked as being deleted
making it invisible to the TrueBlocks explorer.

Use the `--remove` command to permanently remove a monitor from your computer. This is an
irreversible operation and requires the monitor to have been previously deleted.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Add, remove, clean, and list address monitors.

Usage:
  chifra monitors [flags] <address> [address...]

Arguments:
  addrs - one or more addresses (0x...) to process

Flags:
      --clean         clean (i.e. remove duplicate appearances) from monitors
      --delete        delete a monitor, but do not remove it
      --undelete      undelete a previously deleted monitor
      --remove        remove a previously deleted monitor
      --decache       removes a monitor and all associated data from the cache
      --list          list monitors in the cache (--verbose for more detail)
      --watch         continually scan for new blocks and extract data for monitored addresses
  -s, --sleep float   seconds to sleep between monitor passes (default 14)
  -x, --fmt string    export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose       enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help          display this help screen

Notes:
  - An address must start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.
  - If no address is presented to the --clean command, all monitors will be cleaned.
  - The --decache option will remove all cache items (blocks, txs, traces, recons) for the given address(es).

## chifra names

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
`chifra names` is a surprisingly useful tool. It allows one to associate textual names with Ethereum
addresses. One may ask why this is necessary given that ENS exists. The answer is a single
word: "privacy". ENS names are public. In many cases, users desire to keep personal addresses
private. Try to do this on a website.

Like `chifra abis`, this tool is useful from the command line but is primarily used in support of
other tools, especially `chifra export` where naming addresses becomes the single best way to
turn unintelligible blockchain data into understandable information.

The various options allow you to search and filter the results. The `tags` option is used primarily
by the TrueBlocks explorer.

You may use the TrueBlocks explorer to manage (add, edit, delete) address-name associations.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Query addresses or names of well known accounts.

Usage:
  chifra names [flags] <term> [term...]

Arguments:
  terms - a space separated list of one or more search terms (required)

Flags:
  -e, --expand       expand search to include all fields (search name, address, and symbol otherwise)
  -m, --match_case   do case-sensitive search
  -l, --all          include all accounts in the search
  -c, --custom       include your custom named accounts
  -p, --prefund      include prefund accounts
  -n, --named        include well know token and airdrop addresses in the search
  -a, --addr         display only addresses in the results (useful for scripting)
  -g, --tags         export the list of tags and subtags only
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help         display this help screen

Notes:
  - The tool will accept up to three terms, each of which must match against any field in the database.
  - The --match_case option enables case sensitive matching.

## chifra abis

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
`chifra abis` retrieves ABI files for the given address(es). It searches for the ABI in this order:
the current local folder, the TrueBlocks cache, [Etherscan](http://etherscan.io), or (in the
future) ENS and Sourcify.

While this tool may be used from the command line and the API, its primary purpose is in support of
tools such as `chifra export` to support the `--articulate` option.

The `--known` option prints a list of semi-standard function signatures such as the ERC20 standard,
ERC 721 standard, various functions from OpenZeppelin, various Uniswap functions, etc. As an
optimization, the `known` signatures are searched first during articulation.

The `--sol` option converts the provided Solidity file into an ABI json file. The results are
dropped into the current working folder.

The `--find` option is experimental. Please see the notes below for more information.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Fetches the ABI for a smart contract.

Usage:
  chifra abis [flags] <address> [address...]

Arguments:
  addrs - a list of one or more smart contracts whose ABIs to display (required)

Flags:
  -k, --known             load common 'known' ABIs from cache
  -s, --sol               extract the abi definition from the provided .sol file(s)
  -f, --find strings      search for function or event declarations given a four- or 32-byte code(s)
  -n, --hint strings      for the --find option only, provide hints to speed up the search
  -g, --generate string   generate the 32-byte encoding given a cannonical function or event signature
  -x, --fmt string        export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv]
  -v, --verbose           enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help              display this help screen

Notes:
  - For the --sol option, place the solidity files in the current working folder.
  - Search for either four byte signatures or event signatures with the --find option.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
### notes

The `chifra abis --find` option scans the cross product of two sets. The first set contains more than 100,000 function and event
names. The second set contains approximately 700 function signatures. The cross product of these two sets creates 70,000,000
combinations of name(signature) each of which is hashed to create either a four-byte or a 32-byte hash. Very infrequently,
the tool will find matches for an otherwise unknown signatures.
