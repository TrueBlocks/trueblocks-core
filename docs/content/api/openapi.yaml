  title: TrueBlocks API
  description: >
   A REST layer over the TrueBlocks application. With `chifra serve`, you can
   run this on your own machine, and make calls to local host.

   ## Before you begin.  
   * [Install the trueblocks-core application] on your machine, change your configs as needed.
   * Run `chifra serve`

    ## How to make calls
    
    By default, all calls are to localhost:8080. All options and flags are passed
    through query parameters. Like the endpoints, the query parameters are exact
    translations of the chifra cli application. These commands [have their own
    documentation page](https://trueblocks.io/docs/chifra/introducing-chifra/).
  
    For detailed descriptions of fields, see [the data model reference](/data-model/intro/intro).
