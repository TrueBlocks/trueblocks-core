## chifra slurp

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
`chifra slurp` is the first tool we built in the Ethereum space. It even has its [own website](http://ethslurp.com).

While it's useful, it has two shortcomings. First, it is fully centralized, pulling its data from
[http://etherscan.io](http://etherscan.io). Second, is that it does not report every transaction
for a given account. This is actually a shortcoming with Etherscan. It's too complicated to explain
here, but see our blog.

While `chifra slurp` has its shortcomings, it does provides some nice features. You may use it to pull
any transaction initiated by an EOA for example or to explore mining rewards. Visit the above
referenced website for more information.
