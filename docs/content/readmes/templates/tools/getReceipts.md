## [{NAME}]

`[{NAME}]` returns the given transaction's receipt. You may specify multiple transaction identifiers per invocation.

The `--articulate` option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract (including those encountered in a trace--if the `--trace` option is enabled) to better describe the reported data.

Generally speaking, this tool is less useful than others as you may report the same data using `chifra transactions` and more focused data using `chifra logs`. It is included here for completeness, as the `receipt` is a fundamental data structure in Ethereum.
