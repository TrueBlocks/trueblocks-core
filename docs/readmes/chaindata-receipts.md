## chifra receipts

`chifra receipts` returns the given transaction's receipt. You may specify multiple transaction identifiers per invocation.

The `--articulate` option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract (including those encountered in a trace--if the `--trace` option is enabled) to better describe the reported data.

Generally speaking, this tool is less useful than others as you may report the same data using `chifra transactions` and more focused data using `chifra logs`. It is included here for completeness, as the `receipt` is a fundamental data structure in Ethereum.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Retrieve receipts for the given transaction(s).

Usage:
  chifra receipts [flags] <tx_id> [tx_id...]

Arguments:
  transactions - a space-separated list of one or more transaction identifiers (required)

Flags:
  -a, --articulate   articulate the retrieved data if ABIs can be found

Global Flags:
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -h, --help         display this help screen
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)

Notes:
  - The transactions list may be one or more space-separated identifiers which are either a transaction hash, a blockNumber.transactionID pair, or a blockHash.transactionID pair, or any combination.
  - This tool checks for valid input syntax, but does not check that the transaction requested actually exists.
  - If the queried node does not store historical state, the results for most older transactions are undefined.
