## chifra daemon

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
`chifra daemon` manages chifra's long-running processes include its JSON API server. Each of the
`chifra` commands along with all of its options, are provided not only by the command line, but
also the API server. We call this process the `flame` server, which is written in Go.

In the future, this daemon may also manage other long-running processes.

Another way to get help to run `chifra --help` or `chifra <cmd> --help` on your command line.
See below for an example of converting command line options to a call to the API. There's a
one-to-one correspondence between the command line tools and options and the API routes and
their options.
