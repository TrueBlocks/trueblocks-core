## chifra export

The `chifra export` tools provides a major part of the functionality of the TrueBlocks system. Using the index of appearances created with `chifra scrape` and the list of transaction identifiers created with `chifra list`, `chifra export` completes the actual extraction of an address's transactional history from the node.

You may use `topics`, `fourbyte` values at the start of a transaction's input data, and/or a log's `source address` or `emitter` to filter the results.

You may also choose which portions of the Ethereum data structures (`--transactions`, `--logs`, `--traces`, etc.) as you wish.

By default, the results of the extraction are delivered to your console, however, you may export the results to any database (with a little bit of work). The format of the data, its content and its destination are up to you.

`Notes:`

- An `address` must start with '0x' and be forty-two characters long.

`Configurable Items:`

`cache_txs`: write transactions to the cache (see notes).
`cache_traces`: write traces to the cache (see notes).
`skip_ddos`: toggle skipping over 2016 dDos transactions ('on' by default).
`max_traces`: if --skip_ddos is on, this many traces defines what a ddos transaction
  is (default = 250).
