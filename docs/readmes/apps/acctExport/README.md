## [{NAME}]

This folder contains a TrueBlocks monitor. TrueBlocks monitors pull transactions from the Ethereum blockchain for a given (or a series of) Ethereum addresses.

Below we present the command line interface to this tool, although the tool itself is not available under open source. While the tool is in active development, TrueBlocks monitors already produce very useful results. For example, we use TrueBlocks monitors to account for and analyze all transactions on a given smart contract. We present [this example](http://dao.quickblocks.io).
