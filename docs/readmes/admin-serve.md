## chifra serve

`chifra serve` delivers a JSON API for each of the `chifra` commands along with each of its options.
It does this through `flame` server, which is written in Go.

Another way to get help to run `chifra --help` or `chifra <cmd> --help` on your command line. See below for an example of converting command line options to a call to the API. There's a one-to-one correspondence between the command line tools and options and the API routes and their options.
