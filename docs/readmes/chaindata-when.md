## chifra when

The `chifra when` tool answers one of two questions: (1) "At what date and time did a given block occur?" or (2) "What block occurred at or before a given date and time?"

In the first case, supply a block number or hash and the date and time of that block are displayed. In the later case, supply a date (and optionally a time) and the block number that occurred at or just prior to that date is displayed.

The values for `date` and `time` are specified in JSON format. `hour`/`minute`/`second` are optional, and if omitted, default to zero in each case. Block numbers may be specified as either integers or hexidecimal number or block hashes. You may specify any number of dates and/or blocks per invocation.

```
Purpose:
  Find block(s) based on date, blockNum, timestamp, or 'special'.

Usage:
  chifra when [flags] < block | date > [ block... | date... ]

Arguments:
  blocks - one or more dates, block numbers, hashes, or special named blocks (see notes) (required)

Flags:
  -l, --list         export a list of the 'special' blocks
  -t, --timestamps   ignore other options and generate timestamps only

Global Flags:
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -h, --help         display this help screen
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)

Notes:
  - The block list may contain any combination of number, hash, date, special named blocks.
  - Dates must be formatted in JSON format: YYYY-MM-DD[THH[:MM[:SS]]].
