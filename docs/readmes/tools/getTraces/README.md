## chifra traces

The `chifra traces` tool retrieves a transaction's traces. You may specify multiple transaction identifiers per invocation.

The `--articulate` option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract to better describe the reported data.

The `--filter` option calls your node's `trace_filter` routine (if available) using a bang-separated string of the same values used by `trace_fitler`.

### usage

`Usage:`    chifra traces [-a|-f|-d|-c|-v|-h] &lt;tx_id&gt; [tx_id...]

`Notes:`

- The `transactions` list may be one or more space-separated identifiers which are either a transaction hash,
  a blockNumber.transactionID pair, or a blockHash.transactionID pair, or any combination.
- This tool checks for valid input syntax, but does not check that the transaction requested actually exists.
- If the queried node does not store historical state, the results for most older transactions are undefined.
- A bang seperated filter has the following fields (at least one of which is required) and is separated
  with a bang (!): fromBlk, toBlk, fromAddr, toAddr, after, count.
- A state diff trace describes, for each modified address, what changed during that trace.

`Configurable Items:`

- `skip_ddos`: skip over the 2016 ddos during export ('on' by default).
- `max`: if --skip_ddos is on, this many traces defines what a ddos transaction is (default = 250).
