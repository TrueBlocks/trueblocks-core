## Introduction

TrueBlocks improves access to blockchain data for any EVM-compatible chain (particularly Ethereum mainnet) while remaining entirely local.

Features include:

- `chifra init` and `chifra scrape` which builds the Unchained Index, an index of address appearances that provides lightning-fast access to transactional histories,

- An optional binary cache, which speeds up queries to the RPC by orders of magnitude,

- Enhanced command-line options enabling much better access to chain data for data scientists and analysts. For example, easily extract all `logs` produced by a smart
contract or view all ERC-20 holdings for an account, etc.,

- Advanced tools for producing reconciled "bank statements" and accounting export for any token including ETH.
  
- An infinite number of other things restricted only by your imagination.

## Installing

These instructions assume you know how to use the command line. If you need help, see the [installation's troubleshooting section](https://trueblocks.io/docs/install/install-trueblocks/#troubleshooting) or consult Google.

TrueBlocks runs on Linux and Mac. There is no support for Windows.

**Install dependencies**

TrueBlocks requires Go version 1.18 or later. Install the [latest Go version](https://golang.org/doc/install). Verify the version you're running with:

```[shell]
go version
```

Install the following required dependencies for your operating system:

`build-essential git cmake ninja python3 libcurl3-dev clang-format jq`

Adjust this for the particulars for your operating system (probably `apt-get` on linux and `brew install` on Mac).

**Building the repo**

Download and build the repo using these commands:

```[shell]
git clone -b develop https://github.com/trueblocks/trueblocks-core
cd trueblocks-core
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../src
make
```

**Note:** Speed up the build with `make -j <ncores>` where `ncores` represents the number of cores to use.

**Add `./trueblocks-core/bin` to your $PATH**

Add the executable's folder to you path. Consult Google if you don't know how. The following instructions assume you've set the $PATH properly so that `chifra --help` works.

**Edit the configuration**

If you've sucessfully built the executable and set the `$PATH`, you should be able to run:

```[shell]
chifra status --terse
```

and get results. If you get an error, the most likely cause is an incomplete configuration. The error message will report the location of the config file:

- `~/.local/share/trueblocks/trueBlocks.toml`, or
- `~/Library/Application Support/TrueBlocks/trueBlocks.toml`, or
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` if set.

Edit the `trueblocks.toml` file and set the `rpcProvider` to point to a valid RPC endpoint for your chain.

The configuration file is reasonably-well documented. Review other settins, most of which are self-explanitory.

**Searching account histories**

While optional, you most likely want to use the Unchained Index to search account histories. To do so, [get the index](https://trueblocks.io/docs/install/get-the-index/).

**Account explorer**

You may use the command line, of course, to access data, but you may also wish to run an API server:

```[shell]
chifra daemon
```

Use `curl` to pull data or use it to drive our "pre-beta" Account Explorer. See [installing the explorer](https://trueblocks.io/docs/install/install-explorer/). The API provides the identical tools and options as the command line and it [documented here](https://trueblocks.io/api/).

## Command line

The TrueBlocks command-line tool is called `chifra`. This gives you access to all the other tools:

```[shell]
chifra --help
```

Get more help on any sub-command with `chifra <cmd> --help`. Full documentation is available on [our website](https://trueblocks.io).

**Getting data**

Let's look at the first subcommand, called `status`.

```[shell]
chifra status --terse
```

If you get a bunch of JSON data, congratulations, your installation is working.  Try this command which shows every 10th block between the first and the 100,000th:

```[shell]
chifra blocks 0-100000:10
```

You should see a long stream of data. Kill the display with `Control+C`.

See the entire list of chifra commands with `chifra --help`.

## Troubleshooting

Depending on your setup, you may get the following error message when you run some `chifra` commands:

```[shell]
  Warning: A request to your Ethereum node (http://localhost:8545)
  resulted in the following error [Could not connect to server].
  Specify a valid rpcProvider by editing $CONFIG/trueblocks.toml.
```

Edit the file as instructed. You may find helpful [answers on our FAQ](https://trueblocks.io/blog/faq/).

## The unchained index

The primary data structure produced by TrueBlocks is an index of address appearances called the Unchained Index. This index provides very quick access to transaction histories for a any address.

You may either build the entire index from scratch (requires an EVM-compatible tracing/archive node) or you may download a snapshot of the index build from there.

This process is described in the article [Indexing Addresses](https://trueblocks.io/docs/install/get-the-index/).

## Docker version

Our [official docker version](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-docker) is in a separate repo. Please see that repo for more information on running with Docker.

## Documentation

The TrueBlocks [documentation repo](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-docs) builds the TrueBlocks website. See our website for the [best available documentation](https://trueblocks.io/).
